the aim of the genocide convention is to prevent the intentional destruction of entire human groups , and the part targeted must be significant enough to have an impact on the group as a whole . '' 
in prosecutor v. radislav krstic -- appeals chamber -- judgment -- it-98-33 -lrb- 2004 -rrb- icty 7 -lrb- 19 april 2004 -rrb- paragraphs 8 , 9 , 10 , and 11 addressed the issue of in part and found that `` the part must be a substantial part of that group .

the appeals chamber goes into details of other cases and the opinions of respected commentators on the genocide convention to explain how they came to this conclusion . 
it noted that international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia and the international court of justice had agreed with the narrow interpretation , that biological-physical destruction was necessary for an act to qualify as genocide . 
the echr also noted that at the time of its judgement , apart from courts in germany which had taken a broad view , that there had been few cases of genocide under other convention states municipal laws and that `` there are no reported cases in which the courts of these states have defined the type of group destruction the perpetrator must have intended in order to be found guilty of genocide '' .

other nations feared that including political groups in the definition would invite international intervention in domestic politics . 
however leading genocide scholar william schabas states : `` rigorous examination of the travaux fails to confirm a popular impression in the literature that the opposition to inclusion of political genocide was some soviet machination . 
the ussr argued that the convention 's definition should follow the etymology of the term , and may have feared greater international scrutiny of its own great purge . 
in 2007 the european court of human rights -lrb- echr -rrb- , noted in its judgement on jorgic v. germany case that in 1992 the majority of legal scholars took the narrow view that `` intent to destroy '' in the cppcg meant the intended physical-biological destruction of the protected group and that this was still the majority opinion . 
but the echr also noted that a minority took a broader view and did not consider biological-physical destruction was necessary as the intent to destroy a national , racial , religious or ethnic group was enough to qualify as genocide .

the word genocide was later included as a descriptive term to the process of indictment , but not yet as a formal legal term according to lemming , genocide was defined as `` a coordinated strategy to destroy a group of people , a process that could be accomplished through total annihilation as well as strategies that eliminate key elements of the group 's basic existence , including language , culture , and economic infrastructure .

the study of genocide has mainly been focused towards the legal aspect of the term . 
by formally recognizing the act of genocide as a crime , involves the undergoing prosecution that begins with not only seeing genocide as outrageous past any moral standpoint but also may be a legal liability within international relations . 
when genocide is looked at in a general aspect it is viewed as the deliberate killing of a certain group . 
yet is commonly seen to escape the process of trial and prosecution due to the fact that genocide is more often than not committed by the officials in power of a state or area . 
in 1648 before the term genocide had been coined , the peace of westphalia was established to protect ethnic , national , racial and in some instances religious groups .

the judges continue in paragraph 12 , `` the determination of when the targeted part is substantial enough to meet this requirement may involve a number of considerations . 
the numeric size of the targeted part of the group is the necessary and important starting point , though not in all cases the ending point of the inquiry . 
the number of individuals targeted should be evaluated not only in absolute terms , but also in relation to the overall size of the entire group . 
in addition to the numeric size of the targeted portion , its prominence within the group can be a useful consideration . 
in paragraph 13 the judges raise the issue of the perpetrators ' access to the victims : `` the historical examples of genocide also suggest that the area of the perpetrators ' activity and control , as well as the possible extent of their reach , should be considered .

jonassohn and björnson go on to say that none of these alternative definitions have gained widespread support for various reasons . 
jonassohn and björnson postulate that the major reason why no single generally accepted genocide definition has emerged is because academics have adjusted their focus to emphasise different periods and have found it expedient to use slightly different definitions to help them interpret events .

there has been much debate over categorizing the situation in darfur as genocide . 
the ongoing conflict in darfur , sudan , which started in 2003 , was declared a `` genocide '' by united states secretary of state colin powell on 9 september 2004 in testimony before the senate foreign relations committee . 
the ongoing conflict in darfur , sudan , which started in 2003 , was declared a `` genocide '' by united states secretary of state colin powell on 9 september 2004 in testimony before the senate foreign relations committee . 
in fact , in january 2005 , an international commission of inquiry on darfur , authorized by un security council resolution 1564 of 2004 , issued a report to the secretary-general stating that `` the government of the sudan has not pursued a policy of genocide . '' 
nevertheless , the commission cautioned that `` the conclusion that no genocidal policy has been pursued and implemented in darfur by the government authorities , directly or through the militias under their control , should not be taken in any way as detracting from the gravity of the crimes perpetrated in that region . 
in march 2005 , the security council formally referred the situation in darfur to the prosecutor of the international criminal court , taking into account the commission report but without mentioning any specific crimes .

two permanent members of the security council , the united states and china , abstained from the vote on the referral resolution . 
as of his fourth report to the security council , the prosecutor has found `` reasonable grounds to believe that the individuals identified -lsb- in the un security council resolution 1593 -rsb- have committed crimes against humanity and war crimes , '' but did not find sufficient evidence to prosecute for genocide . 
other authors have focused on the structural conditions leading up to genocide and the psychological and social processes that create an evolution toward genocide .

ervin staub showed that economic deterioration and political confusion and disorganization were starting points of increasing discrimination and violence in many instances of genocides and mass killing . 
a history of devaluation of the group that becomes the victim , past violence against the group that becomes the perpetrator leading to psychological wounds , authoritarian cultures and political systems , and the passivity of internal and external witnesses -lrb- bystanders -rrb- all contribute to the probability that the violence develops into genocide . 
the conditions that lead to genocide provide guidance to early prevention , such as humanizing a devalued group , creating ideologies that embrace all groups , and activating bystander responses . 
the emergence of resistance of bacteria to antibiotics is a common phenomenon . 
emergence of resistance often reflects evolutionary processes that take place during antibiotic therapy . 
for example , antibacterial selection for strains having previously acquired antibacterial-resistance genes was demonstrated in 1943 by the luria -- delbrück experiment . 
antibiotics such as penicillin and erythromycin , which used to have a high efficacy against many bacterial species and strains , have become less effective , due to the increased resistance of many bacterial strains . 
emergence of resistance often reflects evolutionary processes that take place during antibiotic therapy . 
the antibiotic treatment may select for bacterial strains with physiologically or genetically enhanced capacity to survive high doses of antibiotics . 
for example , antibacterial selection for strains having previously acquired antibacterial-resistance genes was demonstrated in 1943 by the luria -- delbrück experiment .

since the activity of antibacterials depends frequently on its concentration , in vitro characterization of antibacterial activity commonly includes the determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration of an antibacterial . 
these findings are based on laboratory studies , and in clinical settings have also been shown to eliminate bacterial infection . 
a bactericidal activity of antibacterials may depend on the bacterial growth phase , and it often requires ongoing metabolic activity and division of bacterial cells .

since the activity of antibacterials depends frequently on its concentration , in vitro characterization of antibacterial activity commonly includes the determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration of an antibacterial . 
these include host defense mechanisms , the location of infection , and the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the antibacterial . 
to predict clinical outcome , the antimicrobial activity of an antibacterial is usually combined with its pharmacokinetic profile , and several pharmacological parameters are used as markers of drug efficacy . 
most target bacterial functions or growth processes . 
those that target the bacterial cell wall -lrb- penicillins and cephalosporins -rrb- or the cell membrane -lrb- polymyxins -rrb- , or interfere with essential bacterial enzymes -lrb- rifamycins , lipiarmycins , quinolones , and sulfonamides -rrb- have bactericidal activities .

with advances in medicinal chemistry , most modern antibacterials are semisynthetic modifications of various natural compounds . 
these include , for example , the beta-lactam antibiotics , which include the penicillins -lrb- produced by fungi in the genus penicillium -rrb- , the cephalosporins , and the carbapenems . 
compounds that are still isolated from living organisms are the aminoglycosides , whereas other antibacterials -- for example , the sulfonamides , the quinolones , and the oxazolidinones -- are produced solely by chemical synthesis .

antibiotics revolutionized medicine in the 20th century , and have together with vaccination led to the near eradication of diseases such as tuberculosis in the developed world . 
their effectiveness and easy access led to overuse , especially in livestock raising , prompting bacteria to develop resistance . 
this has led to widespread problems with antimicrobial and antibiotic resistance , so much as to prompt the world health organization to classify antimicrobial resistance as a `` serious threat -lsb- that -rsb- is no longer a prediction for the future , it is happening right now in every region of the world and has the potential to affect anyone , of any age , in any country '' .

adverse effects range from fever and nausea to major allergic reactions , including photodermatitis and anaphylaxis . 
common side-effects include diarrhea , resulting from disruption of the species composition in the intestinal flora , resulting , for example , in overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria , such as clostridium difficile . 
antibacterials can also affect the vaginal flora , and may lead to overgrowth of yeast species of the genus candida in the vulvo-vaginal area . 
additional side-effects can result from interaction with other drugs , such as elevated risk of tendon damage from administration of a quinolone antibiotic with a systemic corticosteroid . 
some scientists have hypothesized that the indiscriminate use of antibiotics alter the host microbiota and this has been associated with chronic disease .

intrinsic antibacterial resistance may be part of the genetic makeup of bacterial strains . 
for instance , antibacterial resistance genes can be exchanged between different bacterial strains or species via plasmids that carry these resistance genes . 
for example , an antibiotic target may be absent from the bacterial genome . 
the spread of antibacterial resistance often occurs through vertical transmission of mutations during growth and by genetic recombination of dna by horizontal genetic exchange . 
acquired resistance results from a mutation in the bacterial chromosome or the acquisition of extra-chromosomal dna . 
the spread of antibacterial resistance often occurs through vertical transmission of mutations during growth and by genetic recombination of dna by horizontal genetic exchange . 
plasmids that carry several different resistance genes can confer resistance to multiple antibacterials . 
antibacterial-resistant strains and species , sometimes referred to as `` superbugs '' , now contribute to the emergence of diseases that were for a while well controlled . 
for example , emergent bacterial strains causing tuberculosis -lrb- tb -rrb- that are resistant to previously effective antibacterial treatments pose many therapeutic challenges . 
every year , nearly half a million new cases of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis -lrb- mdr-tb -rrb- are estimated to occur worldwide . 
every year , nearly half a million new cases of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis -lrb- mdr-tb -rrb- are estimated to occur worldwide . 
inappropriate antibiotic treatment and overuse of antibiotics have contributed to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria . 
self prescription of antibiotics is an example of misuse . 
the overuse of antibiotics , like penicillin and erythromycin , has been associated with emerging antibiotic resistance since the 1950s . 
common forms of antibiotic misuse include excessive use of prophylactic antibiotics in travelers and failure of medical professionals to prescribe the correct dosage of antibiotics on the basis of the patient 's weight and history of prior use . 
common forms of antibiotic misuse include excessive use of prophylactic antibiotics in travelers and failure of medical professionals to prescribe the correct dosage of antibiotics on the basis of the patient 's weight and history of prior use . 
other forms of misuse include failure to take the entire prescribed course of the antibiotic , incorrect dosage and administration , or failure to rest for sufficient recovery . 
inappropriate antibiotic treatment , for example , is their prescription to treat viral infections such as the common cold . 
one study on respiratory tract infections found `` physicians were more likely to prescribe antibiotics to patients who appeared to expect them '' . 
the issues of misuse and overuse of antibiotics have been addressed by the formation of the us interagency task force on antimicrobial resistance . 
this task force aims to actively address antimicrobial resistance , and is coordinated by the us centers for disease control and prevention , the food and drug administration -lrb- fda -rrb- , and the national institutes of health -lrb- nih -rrb- , as well as other us agencies . 
in france , an `` antibiotics are not automatic '' government campaign started in 2002 and led to a marked reduction of unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions , especially in children . 
the emergence of antibiotic resistance has prompted restrictions on their use in the uk in 1970 -lrb- swann report 1969 -rrb- , and the eu has banned the use of antibiotics as growth-promotional agents since 2003 .

moreover , several organizations -lrb- e.g. , the american society for microbiology -lrb- asm -rrb- , american public health association -lrb- apha -rrb- and the american medical association -lrb- ama -rrb- -rrb- have called for restrictions on antibiotic use in food animal production and an end to all nontherapeutic uses . 
two federal bills -lrb- s. 742 and h.r. 2562 -rrb- aimed at phasing out nontherapeutic use of antibiotics in us food animals were proposed , but have not passed . 
these bills were endorsed by public health and medical organizations , including the american holistic nurses ' association , the american medical association , and the american public health association -lrb- apha -rrb- . 
there has been extensive use of antibiotics in animal husbandry . 
in the united states , the question of emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains due to use of antibiotics in livestock was raised by the us food and drug administration -lrb- fda -rrb- in 1977 . 
in march 2012 , the united states district court for the southern district of new york , ruling in an action brought by the natural resources defense council and others , ordered the fda to revoke approvals for the use of antibiotics in livestock , which violated fda regulations . 
before the early 20th century , treatments for infections were based primarily on medicinal folklore . 
mixtures with antimicrobial properties that were used in treatments of infections were described over 2000 years ago . 
many ancient cultures , including the ancient egyptians and ancient greeks , used specially selected mold and plant materials and extracts to treat infections . 
the term ` antibiosis ' , meaning `` against life '' , was introduced by the french bacteriologist jean paul vuillemin as a descriptive name of the phenomenon exhibited by these early antibacterial drugs .

the effects of some types of mold on infection had been noticed many times over the course of history -lrb- see : history of penicillin -rrb- . 
in 1928 , alexander fleming noticed the same effect in a petri dish , where a number of disease-causing bacteria were killed by a fungus of the genus penicillium . 
fleming postulated that the effect is mediated by an antibacterial compound he named penicillin , and that its antibacterial properties could be exploited for chemotherapy .

vaccines rely on immune modulation or augmentation . 
antibacterial vaccines have been responsible for a drastic reduction in global bacterial diseases . 
vaccines made from attenuated whole cells or lysates have been replaced largely by less reactogenic , cell-free vaccines consisting of purified components , including capsular polysaccharides and their conjugates , to protein carriers , as well as inactivated toxins -lrb- toxoids -rrb- and proteins . 
phage therapy is another option that is being looked into for treating resistant strains of bacteria . 
the way that researchers are doing this is by infecting pathogenic bacteria with their own viruses , more specifically , bacteriophages . 
one of the worries about using phages to fight pathogens is that the phages will infect `` good '' bacteria , or the bacteria that are important in the everyday function of human beings . 
since 2009 , only 2 new antibiotics were approved in the united states . 
the report identified seven antibiotics against the gram-negative bacilli -lrb- gnb -rrb- currently in phase 2 or phase 3 clinical trials . 
in april 2013 , the infectious disease society of america -lrb- idsa -rrb- reported that the weak antibiotic pipeline does not match bacteria 's increasing ability to develop resistance . 
possible improvements include clarification of clinical trial regulations by fda . 
furthermore , appropriate economic incentives could persuade pharmaceutical companies to invest in this endeavor . 
antibiotic development to advance patient treatment -lrb- adapt -rrb- act aims to fast track the drug development to combat the growing threat of ` superbugs ' . 
according to allan coukell , senior director for health programs at the pew charitable trusts , `` by allowing drug developers to rely on smaller datasets , and clarifying fda 's authority to tolerate a higher level of uncertainty for these drugs when making a risk/benefit calculation , adapt would make the clinical trials more feasible .

they performed together on seven occasions between 1833 and 1841 . 
the first , on 2 april 1833 , was at a benefit concert organized by hector berlioz for his bankrupt shakespearean actress wife harriet smithson , during which they played george onslow 's sonata in f minor for piano duet . 
although the two displayed great respect and admiration for each other , their friendship was uneasy and had some qualities of a love-hate relationship . 
harold c. schonberg believes that chopin displayed a `` tinge of jealousy and spite '' towards liszt 's virtuosity on the piano , and others have also argued that he had become enchanted with liszt 's theatricality , showmanship and success . 
however , chopin expressed annoyance in 1843 when liszt performed one of his nocturnes with the addition of numerous intricate embellishments , at which chopin remarked that he should play the music as written or not play it at all , forcing an apology . 
most biographers of chopin state that after this the two had little to do with each other , although in his letters dated as late as 1848 he still referred to him as `` my friend liszt '' . 
liszt was the dedicatee of chopin 's op. 10 études , and his performance of them prompted the composer to write to hiller , `` i should like to rob him of the way he plays my studies . '' 
some commentators point to events in the two men 's romantic lives which led to a rift between them ; there are claims that liszt had displayed jealousy of his mistress marie d'agoult 's obsession with chopin , while others believe that chopin had become concerned about liszt 's growing relationship with george sand .

in 1836 , at a party hosted by marie d'agoult , chopin met the french author george sand -lrb- born -lsb- amantine -rsb- aurore -lsb- lucile -rsb- dupin -rrb- . 
chopin finally placed the letters from maria and her mother in a package on which he wrote , in polish , `` my tragedy '' . 
sand , in a letter to grzymała of june 1838 , admitted strong feelings for the composer and debated whether to abandon a current affair in order to begin a relationship with chopin ; she asked grzymała to assess chopin 's relationship with maria wodzińska , without realising that the affair , at least from maria 's side , was over .

in june 1837 chopin visited london incognito in the company of the piano manufacturer camille pleyel where he played at a musical soirée at the house of english piano maker james broadwood . 
on his return to paris , his association with sand began in earnest , and by the end of june 1838 they had become lovers . 
sand , who was six years older than the composer , and who had had a series of lovers , wrote at this time : `` i must say i was confused and amazed at the effect this little creature had on me ... i have still not recovered from my astonishment , and if i were a proud person i should be feeling humiliated at having been carried away ... '' the two spent a miserable winter on majorca -lrb- 8 november 1838 to 13 february 1839 -rrb- , where , together with sand 's two children , they had journeyed in the hope of improving the health of chopin and that of sand 's 15-year-old son maurice , and also to escape the threats of sand 's former lover félicien mallefille .

during the summers at nohant , particularly in the years 1839 -- 43 , chopin found quiet , productive days during which he composed many works , including his polonaise in a-flat major , op. 53 . 
among the visitors to nohant were delacroix and the mezzo-soprano pauline viardot , whom chopin had advised on piano technique and composition . 
delacroix gives an account of staying at nohant in a letter of 7 june 1842 :

from 1842 onwards , chopin showed signs of serious illness . 
after a solo recital in paris on 21 february 1842 , he wrote to grzymała : `` i have to lie in bed all day long , my mouth and tonsils are aching so much . '' 
he was forced by illness to decline a written invitation from alkan to participate in a repeat performance of the beethoven seventh symphony arrangement at erard 's on 1 march 1843 . 
late in 1844 , charles hallé visited chopin and found him `` hardly able to move , bent like a half-opened penknife and evidently in great pain '' , although his spirits returned when he started to play the piano for his visitor . 
modern research suggests that apart from any other illnesses , he may also have suffered from temporal lobe epilepsy .

chopin 's relations with sand were soured in 1846 by problems involving her daughter solange and solange 's fiancé , the young fortune-hunting sculptor auguste clésinger . 
chopin was utterly indifferent to sand 's radical political pursuits , while sand looked on his society friends with disdain . 
as the composer 's illness progressed , sand had become less of a lover and more of a nurse to chopin , whom she called her `` third child '' . 
in 1847 sand published her novel lucrezia floriani , whose main characters -- a rich actress and a prince in weak health -- could be interpreted as sand and chopin ; the story was uncomplimentary to chopin , who could not have missed the allusions as he helped sand correct the printer 's galleys .

in 1844 he wrote only the op. 58 sonata . 
although these works were more refined than many of his earlier compositions , zamoyski opines that `` his powers of concentration were failing and his inspiration was beset by anguish , both emotional and intellectual . ''

chopin 's public popularity as a virtuoso began to wane , as did the number of his pupils , and this , together with the political strife and instability of the time , caused him to struggle financially .

improvisation stands at the centre of chopin 's creative processes . 
however , this does not imply impulsive rambling : nicholas temperley writes that `` improvisation is designed for an audience , and its starting-point is that audience 's expectations , which include the current conventions of musical form . ''

j. barrie jones suggests that `` amongst the works that chopin intended for concert use , the four ballades and four scherzos stand supreme '' , and adds that `` the barcarolle op. 60 stands apart as an example of chopin 's rich harmonic palette coupled with an italianate warmth of melody . ''

temperley opines that these works , which contain `` immense variety of mood , thematic material and structural detail '' , are based on an extended `` departure and return '' form ; `` the more the middle section is extended , and the further it departs in key , mood and theme , from the opening idea , the more important and dramatic is the reprise when it at last comes .

however , some also show unusual sophistication , for example op. 63 no. 3 , which includes a canon at one beat 's distance , a great rarity in music . 
as with the traditional polonaise , chopin 's works are in triple time and typically display a martial rhythm in their melodies , accompaniments and cadences .

inspired by j.s. bach 's the well-tempered clavier , chopin 's preludes move up the circle of fifths -lrb- rather than bach 's chromatic scale sequence -rrb- to create a prelude in each major and minor tonality . 
the preludes were perhaps not intended to be played as a group , and may even have been used by him and later pianists as generic preludes to others of his pieces , or even to music by other composers , as kenneth hamilton suggests : he has noted a recording by ferruccio busoni of 1922 , in which the prelude op. 28 no. 7 is followed by the étude op. 10 no. 5 . 
the preludes , many of which are very brief -lrb- some consisting of simple statements and developments of a single theme or figure -rrb- , were described by schumann as `` the beginnings of studies '' .

the two mature piano sonatas -lrb- no. 2 , op. 35 , written in 1839 and no. 3 , op. 58 , written in 1844 -rrb- are in four movements . 
the op. 58 sonata is closer to the german tradition , including many passages of complex counterpoint , `` worthy of brahms '' according to the music historians kornel michałowski and jim samson .

the two mature piano sonatas -lrb- no. 2 , op. 35 , written in 1839 and no. 3 , op. 58 , written in 1844 -rrb- are in four movements . 
chord progressions sometimes anticipate the shifting tonality of later composers such as claude debussy , as does chopin 's use of modal harmony . 
chopin 's harmonic innovations may have arisen partly from his keyboard improvisation technique . 
temperley says that in his works `` novel harmonic effects frequently result from the combination of ordinary appoggiaturas or passing notes with melodic figures of accompaniment '' , and cadences are delayed by the use of chords outside the home key -lrb- neapolitan sixths and diminished sevenths -rrb- , or by sudden shifts to remote keys . 
his style was based extensively on his use of very independent finger technique . 
in 1841 , léon escudier wrote of a recital given by chopin that year , `` one may say that chopin is the creator of a school of piano and a school of composition . 
in his projet de méthode he wrote : `` everything is a matter of knowing good fingering ... we need no less to use the rest of the hand , the wrist , the forearm and the upper arm . '' 
polish composers of the following generation included virtuosi such as moritz moszkowski , but , in the opinion of j. barrie jones , his `` one worthy successor '' among his compatriots was karol szymanowski -lrb- 1882 -- 1937 -rrb- . 
edvard grieg , antonín dvořák , isaac albéniz , pyotr ilyich tchaikovsky and sergei rachmaninoff , among others , are regarded by critics as having been influenced by chopin 's use of national modes and idioms . 
alexander scriabin was devoted to the music of chopin , and his early published works include nineteen mazurkas , as well as numerous études and preludes ; his teacher nikolai zverev drilled him in chopin 's works to improve his virtuosity as a performer .

jonathan bellman writes that modern concert performance style -- set in the `` conservatory '' tradition of late 19th - and 20th-century music schools , and suitable for large auditoria or recordings -- militates against what is known of chopin 's more intimate performance technique . 
contemporary accounts indicate that in performance , chopin avoided rigid procedures sometimes incorrectly attributed to him , such as `` always crescendo to a high note '' , but that he was concerned with expressive phrasing , rhythmic consistency and sensitive colouring .

the composer himself said to a pupil that `` concerts are never real music , you have to give up the idea of hearing in them all the most beautiful things of art . '' 
berlioz wrote in 1853 that chopin `` has created a kind of chromatic embroidery ... whose effect is so strange and piquant as to be impossible to describe ... virtually nobody but chopin himself can play this music and give it this unusual turn '' . 
hiller wrote that `` what in the hands of others was elegant embellishment , in his hands became a colourful wreath of flowers . '' 
chopin 's music is frequently played with rubato , `` the practice in performance of disregarding strict time , ` robbing ' some note-values for expressive effect '' .

charles rosen comments that `` most of the written-out indications of rubato in chopin are to be found in his mazurkas ... it is probable that chopin used the older form of rubato so important to mozart ... -lsb- where -rsb- the melody note in the right hand is delayed until after the note in the bass ... an allied form of this rubato is the arpeggiation of the chords thereby delaying the melody note ; according to chopin 's pupil , karol mikuli , chopin was firmly opposed to this practice .

barbara milewski suggests that chopin 's experience of polish music came more from `` urbanised '' warsaw versions than from folk music , and that attempts -lrb- by jachimecki and others -rrb- to demonstrate genuine folk music in his works are without basis . 
george golos refers to earlier `` nationalist '' composers in central europe , including poland 's michał kleofas ogiński and franciszek lessel , who utilised polonaise and mazurka forms . 
richard taruskin impugns schumann 's attitude toward chopin 's works as patronizing and comments that chopin `` felt his polish patriotism deeply and sincerely '' but consciously modelled his works on the tradition of bach , beethoven , schubert and field . 
although chopin 's music undoubtedly came to him intuitively rather than through any conscious patriotic design , it served all the same to symbolize the will of the polish people ... '' 
a reconciliation of these views is suggested by william atwood : `` undoubtedly -lsb- chopin 's -rsb- use of traditional musical forms like the polonaise and mazurka roused nationalistic sentiments and a sense of cohesiveness amongst those poles scattered across europe and the new world ... while some sought solace in -lsb- them -rsb- , others found them a source of strength in their continuing struggle for freedom .

he also notes that chopin was fortunate to arrive in paris in 1831 -- `` the artistic environment , the publishers who were willing to print his music , the wealthy and aristocratic who paid what chopin asked for their lessons '' -- and these factors , as well as his musical genius , also fuelled his contemporary and later reputation .

some mainland chinese scholars , such as wang jiawei and nyima gyaincain , assert that the ming dynasty had unquestioned sovereignty over tibet , pointing to the ming court 's issuing of various titles to tibetan leaders , tibetans ' full acceptance of these titles , and a renewal process for successors of these titles that involved traveling to the ming capital . 
some scholars underscore the commercial aspect of the ming-tibetan relationship , noting the ming dynasty 's shortage of horses for warfare and thus the importance of the horse trade with tibet .

some scholars note that tibetan leaders during the ming frequently engaged in civil war and conducted their own foreign diplomacy with neighboring states such as nepal . 
at times the tibetans also used armed resistance against ming forays . 
by the late 16th century , the mongols were successful armed protectors of the gelug dalai lama , after increasing their presence in the amdo region . 
this culminated in güshi khan 's -lrb- 1582 -- 1655 -rrb- conquest of tibet from 1637 -- 1642 and the establishment of the ganden phodrang regime by the 5th dalai lama with his help . 
the wanli emperor -lrb- r. 1572 -- 1620 -rrb- made attempts to reestablish sino-tibetan relations after the mongol-tibetan alliance initiated in 1578 , which affected the foreign policy of the subsequent qing dynasty -lrb- 1644 -- 1912 -rrb- of china in their support for the dalai lama of the gelug school .

during the five dynasties and ten kingdoms period of china -lrb- 907 -- 960 -rrb- , while the fractured political realm of china saw no threat in a tibet which was in just as much political disarray , there was little in the way of sino-tibetan relations .

karma pakshi , 2nd karmapa lama -lrb- 1203 -- 1283 -rrb- -- the head lama of the karma kagyu lineage of tibetan buddhism -- rejected kublai 's invitation , so instead kublai invited drogön chögyal phagpa -lrb- 1235 -- 1280 -rrb- , successor and nephew of sakya pandita , who came to his court in 1253 . 
kublai instituted a unique relationship with the phagpa lama , which recognized kublai as a superior sovereign in political affairs and the phagpa lama as the senior instructor to kublai in religious affairs . 
kublai khan did not conquer the song dynasty in south china until 1279 , so tibet was a component of the early mongol empire before it was combined into one of its descendant empires with the whole of china under the yuan dynasty -lrb- 1271 -- 1368 -rrb- .

morris rossabi also writes that `` tibet , which had extensive contacts with china during the yuan , scarcely had diplomatic relations with the ming . '' 
the historian tsepon w. d. shakabpa supports van praag 's position . 
however , wang jiawei and nyima gyaincain state that these assertions by van praag and shakabpa are `` fallacies '' . 
wang and nyima argue that the ming emperor sent edicts to tibet twice in the second year of the ming dynasty , and demonstrated that he viewed tibet as a significant region to pacify by urging various tibetan tribes to submit to the authority of the ming court . 
they note that at the same time , the mongol prince punala , who had inherited his position as ruler of areas of tibet , went to nanjing in 1371 to pay tribute and show his allegiance to the ming court , bringing with him the seal of authority issued by the yuan court . 
they also state that since successors of lamas granted the title of `` prince '' had to travel to the ming court to renew this title , and since lamas called themselves princes , the ming court therefore had `` full sovereignty over tibet . '' 
they state that the ming dynasty , by issuing imperial edicts to invite ex-yuan officials to the court for official positions in the early years of its founding , won submission from ex-yuan religious and administrative leaders in the tibetan areas , and thereby incorporated tibetan areas into the rule of the ming court . 
journalist and author thomas laird , in his book the story of tibet : conversations with the dalai lama , writes that wang and nyima present the government viewpoint of the people 's republic of china in their historical status of china 's tibet , and fail to realize that china was `` absorbed into a larger , non-chinese political unit '' during the mongol yuan dynasty , which wang and nyima paint as a characteristic chinese dynasty succeeded by the ming . 
laird asserts that the ruling mongol khans never administered tibet as part of china and instead ruled them as separate territories , comparing the mongols with the british who colonized india and new zealand , yet stating this does not make india part of new zealand as a consequence .

it describes the yuan dynasty as `` a mongol dynasty of china that ruled from 1271 to 1368 , and a division of the great empire conquered by the mongols . 
the encyclopedia americana describes the yuan dynasty as `` the line of mongol rulers in china '' and adds that the mongols `` proclaimed a chinese-style yüan dynasty at khanbaliq -lrb- beijing -rrb- . '' 
the metropolitan museum of art writes that the mongol rulers of the yuan dynasty `` adopted chinese political and cultural models ; ruling from their capitals in dadu , they assumed the role of chinese emperors , '' although tibetologist thomas laird dismissed the yuan dynasty as a non-chinese polity and plays down its chinese characteristics . 
in his kublai khan : his life and times , rossabi explains that kublai `` created government institutions that either resembled or were the same as the traditional chinese ones '' , and he `` wished to signal to the chinese that he intended to adopt the trappings and style of a chinese ruler '' . 
it describes the yuan dynasty as `` a mongol dynasty of china that ruled from 1271 to 1368 , and a division of the great empire conquered by the mongols . 
kublai also abolished the imperial examinations of china 's civil service legacy , which was not reinstated until ayurbarwada buyantu khan 's reign -lrb- 1311 -- 1320 -rrb- . 
van praag writes that `` tibet remained a unique part of the empire and was never fully integrated into it , '' citing examples such as a licensed border market that existed between china and tibet during the yuan . 
nevertheless , the ethno-geographic caste hierarchy favoring the mongols and other ethnicities were accorded higher status than the han chinese majority . 
the official position of the ministry of foreign affairs of the people 's republic of china is that the ming implemented a policy of managing tibet according to conventions and customs , granting titles and setting up administrative organs over tibet . 
for example , an edict of the hongwu emperor in 1373 appointed the tibetan leader choskunskyabs as the general of the ngari military and civil wanhu office , stating : 
the state council information office of the people 's republic states that the ming dynasty 's ü-tsang commanding office governed most areas of tibet . 
chen qingying , professor of history and director of the history studies institute under the china tibetology research center in beijing , writes that the ming court conferred new official positions on ex-yuan tibetan leaders of the phachu kargyu and granted them lower-ranking positions .

according to tibetologist john powers , tibetan sources counter this narrative of titles granted by the chinese to tibetans with various titles which the tibetans gave to the chinese emperors and their officials . 
the ming emperors sent invitations to ruling lamas , but the lamas sent subordinates rather than coming themselves , and no tibetan ruler ever explicitly accepted the role of being a vassal of the ming .

wylie asserts that this type of censorship of the history of ming distorts the true picture of the history of sino-tibetan relations , while the ming court granted titles to various lamas regardless of their sectarian affiliations in an ongoing civil war in tibet between competing buddhist factions . 
wylie argues that ming titles of `` king '' granted indiscriminately to various tibetan lamas or even their disciples should not be viewed as reappointments to earlier yuan dynasty offices , since the viceregal sakya regime established by the mongols in tibet was overthrown by the phagmodru myriarchy before the ming existed . 
melvyn c. goldstein writes that the ming had no real administrative authority over tibet , as the various titles given to tibetan leaders did not confer authority as the earlier mongol yuan titles had .

the yongle emperor came out of the palace in nanjing to greet the karmapa and did not require him to kowtow like a tributary vassal . 
rossabi and others describe a similar arrangement made by kublai khan and the sakya phagpa lama , writing that kublai would `` sit on a lower platform than the tibetan cleric '' when receiving religious instructions from him . 
norbu writes that the yongle emperor , following the tradition of mongol emperors and their reverence for the sakya lamas , showed an enormous amount of deference towards deshin shekpa . 
at linggu temple in nanjing , he presided over the religious ceremonies for the yongle emperor 's deceased parents , while twenty-two days of his stay were marked by religious miracles that were recorded in five languages on a gigantic scroll that bore the emperor 's seal .

during his stay in nanjing , deshin shekpa was bestowed the title `` great treasure prince of dharma '' by the yongle emperor . 
in fact , this was the same title that kublai khan had offered the sakya phagpa lama , but deshin shekpa persuaded the yongle emperor to grant the title to religious leaders of other tibetan buddhist sects . 
tibetan sources say deshin shekpa also persuaded the yongle emperor not to impose his military might on tibet as the mongols had previously done . 
however , hok-lam chan states that `` there is little evidence that this was ever the emperor 's intention '' and that evidence indicates that deshin skekpa was invited strictly for religious purposes . 
thinley writes that before the karmapa returned to tibet , the yongle emperor began planning to send a military force into tibet to forcibly give the karmapa authority over all the tibetan buddhist schools but deshin shekpa dissuaded him .

with the example of the ming court 's relationship with the fifth karmapa and other tibetan leaders , norbu states that chinese communist historians have failed to realize the significance of the religious aspect of the ming-tibetan relationship . 
he also notes that the items of tribute were buddhist artifacts which symbolized `` the religious nature of the relationship . '' 
josef kolmaš writes that the ming dynasty did not exercise any direct political control over tibet , content with their tribute relations that were `` almost entirely of a religious character . ''

van praag states that the ming court established diplomatic delegations with tibet merely to secure urgently needed horses . 
wang and nyima argue that these were not diplomatic delegations at all , that tibetan areas were ruled by the ming since tibetan leaders were granted positions as ming officials , that horses were collected from tibet as a mandatory `` corvée '' tax , and therefore tibetans were `` undertaking domestic affairs , not foreign diplomacy '' . 
while the ming dynasty traded horses with tibet , it upheld a policy of outlawing border markets in the north , which laird sees as an effort to punish the mongols for their raids and to `` drive them from the frontiers of china . '' 
however , after altan khan -lrb- 1507 -- 1582 -rrb- -- leader of the tümed mongols who overthrew the oirat mongol confederation 's hegemony over the steppes -- made peace with the ming dynasty in 1571 , he persuaded the ming to reopen their border markets in 1573 .

however , there were instances in the 14th century when the hongwu emperor did use military force to quell unrest in tibet . 
john d. langlois writes that there was unrest in tibet and western sichuan , which the marquis mu ying -lrb- 沐英 -rrb- was commissioned to quell in november 1378 after he established a taozhou garrison in gansu . 
langlois notes that by october 1379 , mu ying had allegedly captured 30,000 tibetan prisoners and 200,000 domesticated animals .

rossabi also discounts the `` divide-and-rule '' theory on the grounds of the yongle emperor 's failed attempt to build a strong relationship with the fifth karmapa -- one which he hoped would parallel kublai khan 's earlier relationship with the sakya phagpa lama . 
instead , the yongle emperor followed the karmapa 's advice of giving patronage to many different tibetan lamas .

in 1565 , the powerful rinbung princes were overthrown by one of their own ministers , karma tseten who styled himself as the tsangpa , `` the one of tsang '' , and established his base of power at shigatse .

in 2003 , nintendo announced that a new the legend of zelda game was in the works for the gamecube by the same team that had created the cel-shaded the wind waker . 
at the following year 's game developers conference , director eiji aonuma unintentionally revealed that the game 's sequel was in development under the working title the wind waker 2 ; it was set to use a similar graphical style to that of its predecessor . 
nintendo of america told aonuma that north american sales of the wind waker were sluggish because its cartoon appearance created the impression that the game was designed for a young audience . 
he advised that aonuma should start by doing what could not be done in ocarina of time , particularly horseback combat .

aonuma left his team working on the new idea while he directed the minish cap for the game boy advance . 
at the same time , the wii was under development with the code name `` revolution '' . 
miyamoto thought that the revolution 's pointing device , the wii remote , was well suited for aiming arrows in zelda , and suggested that aonuma consider using it .

his team began work developing a pointing-based interface for the bow and arrow , and aonuma found that aiming directly at the screen gave the game a new feel , just like the ds control scheme for phantom hourglass .

this was denied by producer michael g. wilson , who stated that the scene had always been intended to be shot in mexico as production had been attracted to the imagery of the day of the dead , and that the script had been developed from there .

lee has said that to kill a mockingbird is not an autobiography , but rather an example of how an author `` should write about what he knows and write truthfully '' . 
lee 's father , amasa coleman lee , was an attorney , similar to atticus finch , and in 1919 , he defended two black men accused of murder . 
though scout 's mother died when she was a baby , lee was 25 when her mother , frances cunningham finch , died . 
lee 's father was also the editor and publisher of the monroeville newspaper . 
just as dill lived next door to scout during the summer , capote lived next door to lee with his aunts while his mother visited new york city . 
in 1960 , capote and lee traveled to kansas together to investigate the multiple murders that were the basis for capote 's nonfiction novel in cold blood .

satire and irony are used to such an extent that tavernier-courbin suggests one interpretation for the book 's title : lee is doing the mocking -- of education , the justice system , and her own society by using them as subjects of her humorous disapproval . 
to address complex issues , however , tavernier-courbin notes that lee uses parody , satire , and irony effectively by using a child 's perspective . 
when atticus is out of town , jem locks a sunday school classmate in the church basement with the furnace during a game of shadrach .

scholars have characterized to kill a mockingbird as both a southern gothic and coming-of-age or bildungsroman novel . 
despite challenging the town 's systems , scout reveres atticus as an authority above all others , because he believes that following one 's conscience is the highest priority , even when the result is social ostracism . 
jem says to their neighbor miss maudie the day after the trial , `` it 's like bein ' a caterpillar wrapped in a cocoon ... i always thought maycomb folks were the best folks in the world , least that 's what they seemed like '' . 
this leads him to struggle with understanding the separations of race and class . 
claudia durst johnson considers it `` reasonable to believe '' that the novel was shaped by two events involving racial issues in alabama : rosa parks ' refusal to yield her seat on a city bus to a white person , which sparked the 1955 montgomery bus boycott , and the 1956 riots at the university of alabama after autherine lucy and polly myers were admitted -lrb- myers eventually withdrew her application and lucy was expelled , but reinstated in 1980 -rrb- . 
in the years following its release , many reviewers considered to kill a mockingbird a novel primarily concerned with race relations . 
any transgressions by black males that merely hinted at sexual contact with white females during the time the novel was set often resulted in a punishment of death for the accused . 
although tom is spared from being lynched , he is killed with excessive violence during an attempted escape from prison , shot seventeen times . 
any transgressions by black males that merely hinted at sexual contact with white females during the time the novel was set often resulted in a punishment of death for the accused . 
tom robinson 's trial was juried by poor white farmers who convicted him despite overwhelming evidence of his innocence , as more educated and moderate white townspeople supported the jury 's decision . 
although tom is spared from being lynched , he is killed with excessive violence during an attempted escape from prison , shot seventeen times . 
for example , atticus must shoot a rabid dog , even though it is not his job to do so . 
carolyn jones argues that the dog represents prejudice within the town of maycomb , and atticus , who waits on a deserted street to shoot the dog , must fight against the town 's racism without help from other white citizens . 
when scout embarrasses her poorer classmate , walter cunningham , at the finch home one day , calpurnia , their black cook , chastises and punishes her for doing so . 
atticus respects calpurnia 's judgment , and later in the book even stands up to his sister , the formidable aunt alexandra , when she strongly suggests they fire calpurnia .

in a 1964 interview , lee remarked that her aspiration was `` to be ... the jane austen of south alabama . '' 
both austen and lee challenged the social status quo and valued individual worth over social standing . 
scholars argue that lee 's approach to class and race was more complex `` than ascribing racial prejudice primarily to ` poor white trash ' ... lee demonstrates how issues of gender and class intensify prejudice , silence the voices that might challenge the existing order , and greatly complicate many americans ' conception of the causes of racism and segregation .

'' 
the children internalize atticus ' admonition not to judge someone until they have walked around in that person 's skin , gaining a greater understanding of people 's motives and behavior . 
in a statement that foreshadows atticus ' motivation for defending tom robinson and describes mrs. dubose , who is determined to break herself of a morphine addiction , atticus tells jem that courage is `` when you 're licked before you begin but you begin anyway and you see it through no matter what '' . 
scout 's impulsive inclination to fight students who insult atticus reflects her attempt to stand up for him and defend him . 
the novel has been noted for its poignant exploration of different forms of courage .

by balancing the masculine influences of atticus and jem with the feminine influences of calpurnia and miss maudie , one scholar writes , `` lee gradually demonstrates that scout is becoming a feminist in the south , for with the use of first-person narration , she indicates that scout / jean louise still maintains the ambivalence about being a southern lady she possessed as a child .

bob ewell , it is hinted , molested his daughter , and mr. radley imprisons his son in his house until boo is remembered only as a phantom . 
apart from atticus , the fathers described are abusers . 
many social codes are broken by people in symbolic courtrooms : mr. dolphus raymond has been exiled by society for taking a black woman as his common-law wife and having interracial children ; mayella ewell is beaten by her father in punishment for kissing tom robinson ; by being turned into a non-person , boo radley receives a punishment far greater than any court could have given him . 
the opening quote by the 19th-century essayist charles lamb reads : `` lawyers , i suppose , were children once . '' 
for example , she refuses to wear frilly clothes , saying that aunt alexandra 's `` fanatical '' attempts to place her in them made her feel `` a pink cotton penitentiary closing in on -lsb- her -rsb- '' . 
songbirds and their associated symbolism appear throughout the novel . 
the family 's last name of finch also shares lee 's mother 's maiden name . 
the titular mockingbird is a key motif of this theme , which first appears when atticus , having given his children air-rifles for christmas , allows their uncle jack to teach them to shoot .

an earlier draft of to kill a mockingbird , titled go set a watchman , was controversially released on july 14 , 2015 . 
the novel is renowned for its warmth and humor , despite dealing with the serious issues of rape and racial inequality . 
the narrator 's father , atticus finch , has served as a moral hero for many readers and as a model of integrity for lawyers . 
the strongest element of style noted by critics and reviewers is lee 's talent for narration , which in an early review in time was called `` tactile brilliance '' . 
lee combines the narrator 's voice of a child observing her surroundings with a grown woman 's reflecting on her childhood , using the ambiguity of this voice combined with the narrative technique of flashback to play intricately with perspectives . 
however , she gave some insight into her themes when , in a rare letter to the editor , she wrote in response to the passionate reaction her book caused : `` surely it is plain to the simplest intelligence that to kill a mockingbird spells out in words of seldom more than two syllables a code of honor and conduct , christian in its ethic , that is the heritage of all southerners . '' 
the first part of the novel concerns the children 's fascination with boo radley and their feelings of safety and comfort in the neighborhood . 
one writer was so impressed by lee 's detailed explanations of the people of maycomb that he categorized the book as southern romantic regionalism . 
this regionalist theme is further reflected in mayella ewell 's apparent powerlessness to admit her advances toward tom robinson , and scout 's definition of `` fine folks '' being people with good sense who do the best they can with what they have . 
the south itself , with its traditions and taboos , seems to drive the plot more than the characters . 
tom robinson is the chief example among several innocents destroyed carelessly or deliberately throughout the novel . 
however , scholar christopher metress connects the mockingbird to boo radley : `` instead of wanting to exploit boo for her own fun -lrb- as she does in the beginning of the novel by putting on gothic plays about his history -rrb- , scout comes to see him as a ` mockingbird ' -- that is , as someone with an inner goodness that must be cherished . '' 
the last pages of the book illustrate this as scout relates the moral of a story atticus has been reading to her , and in allusions to both boo radley and tom robinson states about a character who was misunderstood , `` when they finally saw him , why he had n't done any of those things ... atticus , he was real nice , '' to which he responds , `` most people are , scout , when you finally see them . '' 
the novel exposes the loss of innocence so frequently that reviewer r. a. dave claims that because every character has to face , or even suffer defeat , the book takes on elements of a classical tragedy . 
the chicago sunday tribune noted the even-handed approach to the narration of the novel 's events , writing : `` this is in no way a sociological novel . 
some lamented the use of poor white southerners , and one-dimensional black victims , and granville hicks labeled the book `` melodramatic and contrived '' . 
when the book was first released , southern writer flannery o'connor commented , `` i think for a child 's book it does all right . 
chimamanda ngozi adichie writing in the guardian states that lee , rare among american novelists , writes with `` a fiercely progressive ink , in which there is nothing inevitable about racism and its very foundation is open to question '' , comparing her to william faulkner , who wrote about racism as an inevitability . 
literary critic rosemary goring in scotland 's the herald notes the connections between lee and jane austen , stating the book 's central theme , that `` one 's moral convictions are worth fighting for , even at the risk of being reviled '' is eloquently discussed . 
native alabamian allen barra sharply criticized lee and the novel in the wall street journal calling atticus a `` repository of cracker-barrel epigrams '' and the novel represents a `` sugar-coated myth '' of alabama history . 
-lsb- note 2 -rsb- defending the book , akin ajayi writes that justice `` is often complicated , but must always be founded upon the notion of equality and fairness for all . '' 
in its use of racial epithets , stereotyped depictions of superstitious blacks , and calpurnia , who to some critics is an updated version of the `` contented slave '' motif and to others simply unexplored , the book is viewed as marginalizing black characters . 
a canadian language arts consultant found that the novel resonated well with white students , but that black students found it `` demoralizing '' . 
another criticism , articulated by michael lind , is that the novel indulges in classist stereotyping and demonization of poor rural `` white trash '' . 
diane mcwhorter , pulitzer prize-winning historian of the birmingham civil rights campaign , asserts that to kill a mockingbird condemns racism instead of racists , and states that every child in the south has moments of racial cognitive dissonance when they are faced with the harsh reality of inequality . 
mcwhorter writes of lee , `` for a white person from the south to write a book like this in the late 1950s is really unusual -- by its very existence an act of protest . '' 
according to a national geographic article , the novel is so revered in monroeville that people quote lines from it like scripture ; yet harper lee herself refused to attend any performances , because `` she abhors anything that trades on the book 's fame '' . 
local residents call them `` mockingbird groupies '' , and although lee was not reclusive , she refused publicity and interviews with an emphatic `` hell , no ! ''

when planted on the southern side of a building in the northern hemisphere or the northern side in the southern hemisphere , their leaves provide shade during the summer , while the bare limbs allow light to pass during the winter . 
deciduous trees and plants have been promoted as a means of controlling solar heating and cooling . 
since bare , leafless trees shade 1/3 to 1/2 of incident solar radiation , there is a balance between the benefits of summer shading and the corresponding loss of winter heating . 
in climates with significant heating loads , deciduous trees should not be planted on the equator facing side of a building because they will interfere with winter solar availability . 
they can , however , be used on the east and west sides to provide a degree of summer shading without appreciably affecting winter solar gain .

the potential solar energy that could be used by humans differs from the amount of solar energy present near the surface of the planet because factors such as geography , time variation , cloud cover , and the land available to humans limits the amount of solar energy that we can acquire . 
geography effects solar energy potential because areas that are closer to the equator have a greater amount of solar radiation . 
however , the use of photovoltaics that can follow the position of the sun can significantly increase the solar energy potential in areas that are farther from the equator . 
time variation effects the potential of solar energy because during the nighttime there is little solar radiation on the surface of the earth for solar panels to absorb . 
cloud cover can effect the potential of solar panels because clouds block incoming light from the sun and reduce the light available for solar cells . 
in addition , land availability has a large effect on the available solar energy because solar panels can only be set up on land that is unowned and suitable for solar panels . 
roofs have been found to be a suitable place for solar cells , as many people have discovered that they can collect energy directly from their homes this way . 
in 2000 , the united nations development programme , un department of economic and social affairs , and world energy council published an estimate of the potential solar energy that could be used by humans each year that took into account factors such as insolation , cloud cover , and the land that is usable by humans .

anthropology is the study of humans and their societies in the past and present . 
its main subdivisions are social anthropology and cultural anthropology , which describes the workings of societies around the world , linguistic anthropology , which investigates the influence of language in social life , and biological or physical anthropology , which concerns long-term development of the human organism .

since the work of franz boas and bronisław malinowski in the late 19th and early 20th centuries , social anthropology in great britain and cultural anthropology in the us have been distinguished from other social sciences by its emphasis on cross-cultural comparisons , long-term in-depth examination of context , and the importance it places on participant-observation or experiential immersion in the area of research . 
this has been particularly prominent in the united states , from boas ' arguments against 19th-century racial ideology , through margaret mead 's advocacy for gender equality and sexual liberation , to current criticisms of post-colonial oppression and promotion of multiculturalism .

anthropology is a global discipline where humanities , social , and natural sciences are forced to confront one another . 
anthropology builds upon knowledge from natural sciences , including the discoveries about the origin and evolution of homo sapiens , human physical traits , human behavior , the variations among different groups of humans , how the evolutionary past of homo sapiens has influenced its social organization and culture , and from social sciences , including the organization of human social and cultural relations , institutions , social conflicts , etc. . 
anthropology is a global discipline where humanities , social , and natural sciences are forced to confront one another . 
early anthropology originated in classical greece and persia and studied and tried to understand observable cultural diversity . 
as such , anthropology has been central in the development of several new -lrb- late 20th century -rrb- interdisciplinary fields such as cognitive science , global studies , and various ethnic studies . 
sociocultural anthropology has been heavily influenced by structuralist and postmodern theories , as well as a shift toward the analysis of modern societies . 
during the 1970s and 1990s , there was an epistemological shift away from the positivist traditions that had largely informed the discipline . 
-lsb- page needed -rsb- during this shift , enduring questions about the nature and production of knowledge came to occupy a central place in cultural and social anthropology . 
in contrast , archaeology and biological anthropology remained largely positivist . 
due to this difference in epistemology , the four sub-fields of anthropology have lacked cohesion over the last several decades . 
sociocultural anthropology draws together the principle axes of cultural anthropology and social anthropology . 
cultural anthropology is the comparative study of the manifold ways in which people make sense of the world around them , while social anthropology is the study of the relationships among persons and groups . 
in that it helps develop understanding of social structures , typically of others and other populations -lrb- such as minorities , subgroups , dissidents , etc. -rrb- . 
there is no hard-and-fast distinction between them , and these categories overlap to a considerable degree . 
cultural anthropology is the comparative study of the manifold ways in which people make sense of the world around them , while social anthropology is the study of the relationships among persons and groups . 
inquiry in sociocultural anthropology is guided in part by cultural relativism , the attempt to understand other societies in terms of their own cultural symbols and values . 
ethnography can refer to both a methodology and the product of ethnographic research , i.e. an ethnographic monograph . 
participant observation is one of the foundational methods of social and cultural anthropology . 
the process of participant-observation can be especially helpful to understanding a culture from an emic -lrb- conceptual , vs. etic , or technical -rrb- point of view . 
accepting other cultures in their own terms moderates reductionism in cross-cultural comparison . 
sociocultural anthropology also covers economic and political organization , law and conflict resolution , patterns of consumption and exchange , material culture , technology , infrastructure , gender relations , ethnicity , childrearing and socialization , religion , myth , symbols , values , etiquette , worldview , sports , music , nutrition , recreation , games , food , festivals , and language -lrb- which is also the object of study in linguistic anthropology -rrb- .

archaeology is the study of the human past through its material remains . 
archaeologists examine these material remains in order to deduce patterns of past human behavior and cultural practices . 
ethnoarchaeology is a type of archaeology that studies the practices and material remains of living human groups in order to gain a better understanding of the evidence left behind by past human groups , who are presumed to have lived in similar ways . 
ethnoarchaeology is a type of archaeology that studies the practices and material remains of living human groups in order to gain a better understanding of the evidence left behind by past human groups , who are presumed to have lived in similar ways . 
artifacts , faunal remains , and human altered landscapes are evidence of the cultural and material lives of past societies . 
it is the branch of anthropology that brings linguistic methods to bear on anthropological problems , linking the analysis of linguistic forms and processes to the interpretation of sociocultural processes . 
it is the branch of anthropology that brings linguistic methods to bear on anthropological problems , linking the analysis of linguistic forms and processes to the interpretation of sociocultural processes . 
linguistic anthropology -lrb- also called anthropological linguistics -rrb- seeks to understand the processes of human communications , verbal and non-verbal , variation in language across time and space , the social uses of language , and the relationship between language and culture . 
linguistic anthropologists often draw on related fields including sociolinguistics , pragmatics , cognitive linguistics , semiotics , discourse analysis , and narrative analysis . 
one of the central problems in the anthropology of art concerns the universality of ` art ' as a cultural phenomenon . 
several anthropologists have noted that the western categories of ` painting ' , ` sculpture ' , or ` literature ' , conceived as independent artistic activities , do not exist , or exist in a significantly different form , in most non-western contexts . 
to surmount this difficulty , anthropologists of art have focused on formal features in objects which , without exclusively being ` artistic ' , have certain evident ` aesthetic ' qualities . 
boas ' primitive art , claude lévi-strauss ' the way of the masks -lrb- 1982 -rrb- or geertz 's ` art as cultural system ' -lrb- 1983 -rrb- are some examples in this trend to transform the anthropology of ` art ' into an anthropology of culturally specific ` aesthetics ' .

sporadic use of the term for some of the subject matter occurred subsequently , such as the use by étienne serres in 1838 to describe the natural history , or paleontology , of man , based on comparative anatomy , and the creation of a chair in anthropology and ethnography in 1850 at the national museum of natural history -lrb- france -rrb- by jean louis armand de quatrefages de bréau .

the société ethnologique de paris , the first to use ethnology , was formed in 1839 . 
anthropology and many other current fields are the intellectual results of the comparative methods developed in the earlier 19th century . 
theorists in such diverse fields as anatomy , linguistics , and ethnology , making feature-by-feature comparisons of their subject matters , were beginning to suspect that similarities between animals , languages , and folkways were the result of processes or laws unknown to them then . 
theorists in such diverse fields as anatomy , linguistics , and ethnology , making feature-by-feature comparisons of their subject matters , were beginning to suspect that similarities between animals , languages , and folkways were the result of processes or laws unknown to them then . 
for them , the publication of charles darwin 's on the origin of species was the epiphany of everything they had begun to suspect . 
darwin himself arrived at his conclusions through comparison of species he had seen in agronomy and in the wild . 
darwin and wallace unveiled evolution in the late 1850s . 
there was an immediate rush to bring it into the social sciences . 
paul broca in paris was in the process of breaking away from the société de biologie to form the first of the explicitly anthropological societies , the société d'anthropologie de paris , meeting for the first time in paris in 1859 .

-lsb- n 4 -rsb- when he read darwin he became an immediate convert to transformisme , as the french called evolutionism . 
broca , being what today would be called a neurosurgeon , had taken an interest in the pathology of speech . 
broca , being what today would be called a neurosurgeon , had taken an interest in the pathology of speech . 
he discovered the speech center of the human brain , today called broca 's area after him . 
his interest was mainly in biological anthropology , but a german philosopher specializing in psychology , theodor waitz , took up the theme of general and social anthropology in his six-volume work , entitled die anthropologie der naturvölker , 1859 -- 1864 . 
his interest was mainly in biological anthropology , but a german philosopher specializing in psychology , theodor waitz , took up the theme of general and social anthropology in his six-volume work , entitled die anthropologie der naturvölker , 1859 -- 1864 . 
waitz defined anthropology as `` the science of the nature of man '' . 
by nature he meant matter animated by `` the divine breath '' ; i.e. , he was an animist . 
following broca 's lead , waitz points out that anthropology is a new field , which would gather material from other fields , but would differ from them in the use of comparative anatomy , physiology , and psychology to differentiate man from `` the animals nearest to him '' . 
he stresses that the data of comparison must be empirical , gathered by experimentation . 
the history of civilization as well as ethnology are to be brought into the comparison . 
waitz was influential among the british ethnologists . 
in 1863 the explorer richard francis burton and the speech therapist james hunt broke away from the ethnological society of london to form the anthropological society of london , which henceforward would follow the path of the new anthropology rather than just ethnology . 
in 1863 the explorer richard francis burton and the speech therapist james hunt broke away from the ethnological society of london to form the anthropological society of london , which henceforward would follow the path of the new anthropology rather than just ethnology . 
representatives from the french société were present , though not broca . 
in his keynote address , printed in the first volume of its new publication , the anthropological review , hunt stressed the work of waitz , adopting his definitions as a standard . 
this meagre statistic expanded in the 20th century to comprise anthropology departments in the majority of the world 's higher educational institutions , many thousands in number . 
anthropology has diversified from a few major subdivisions to dozens more . 
practical anthropology , the use of anthropological knowledge and technique to solve specific problems , has arrived ; for example , the presence of buried victims might stimulate the use of a forensic archaeologist to recreate the final scene .

for example , the world council of anthropological associations -lrb- wcaa -rrb- , `` a network of national , regional and international associations that aims to promote worldwide communication and cooperation in anthropology '' , currently contains members from about three dozen nations . 
media anthropology -lrb- also known as anthropology of media or mass media -rrb- emphasizes ethnographic studies as a means of understanding producers , audiences , and other cultural and social aspects of mass media . 
the types of ethnographic contexts explored range from contexts of media production -lrb- e.g. , ethnographies of newsrooms in newspapers , journalists in the field , film production -rrb- to contexts of media reception , following audiences in their everyday responses to media . 
this is in addition to many classic ethnographic contexts , where media such as radio , the press , new media and television have started to make their presences felt since the early 1990s .

other types include cyber anthropology , a relatively new area of internet research , as well as ethnographies of other areas of research which happen to involve media , such as development work , social movements , or health education . 
visual anthropology is concerned , in part , with the study and production of ethnographic photography , film and , since the mid-1990s , new media . 
while the term is sometimes used interchangeably with ethnographic film , visual anthropology also encompasses the anthropological study of visual representation , including areas such as performance , museums , art , and the production and reception of mass media . 
visual representations from all cultures , such as sandpaintings , tattoos , sculptures and reliefs , cave paintings , scrimshaw , jewelry , hieroglyphics , paintings and photographs are included in the focus of visual anthropology .

economic anthropology attempts to explain human economic behavior in its widest historic , geographic and cultural scope . 
economic anthropology attempts to explain human economic behavior in its widest historic , geographic and cultural scope . 
it has a complex relationship with the discipline of economics , of which it is highly critical . 
its origins as a sub-field of anthropology begin with the polish-british founder of anthropology , bronislaw malinowski , and his french compatriot , marcel mauss , on the nature of gift-giving exchange -lrb- or reciprocity -rrb- as an alternative to market exchange . 
economic anthropology remains , for the most part , focused upon exchange . 
political economy in anthropology is the application of the theories and methods of historical materialism to the traditional concerns of anthropology , including , but not limited to , non-capitalist societies . 
political economy introduced questions of history and colonialism to ahistorical anthropological theories of social structure and culture . 
sahlins work on hunter-gatherers as the ` original affluent society ' did much to dissipate that image . 
the second area was concerned with the vast majority of the world 's population at the time , the peasantry , many of whom were involved in complex revolutionary wars such as in vietnam . 
more recently , these political economists have more directly addressed issues of industrial -lrb- and post-industrial -rrb- capitalism around the world . 
applied anthropology refers to the application of the method and theory of anthropology to the analysis and solution of practical problems . 
it is a , `` complex of related , research-based , instrumental methods which produce change or stability in specific cultural systems through the provision of data , initiation of direct action , and/or the formulation of policy '' .

anthropology of development tends to view development from a critical perspective . 
the kind of issues addressed and implications for the approach simply involve pondering why , if a key development goal is to alleviate poverty , is poverty increasing ?

why is there such a gap between plans and outcomes ? 
in short why does so much planned development fail ? 
kinship can refer both to the study of the patterns of social relationships in one or more human cultures , or it can refer to the patterns of social relationships themselves . 
over its history , anthropology has developed a number of related concepts and terms , such as `` descent '' , `` descent groups '' , `` lineages '' , `` affines '' , `` cognates '' , and even `` fictive kinship '' . 
over its history , anthropology has developed a number of related concepts and terms , such as `` descent '' , `` descent groups '' , `` lineages '' , `` affines '' , `` cognates '' , and even `` fictive kinship '' . 
broadly , kinship patterns may be considered to include people related both by descent -lrb- one 's social relations during development -rrb- , and also relatives by marriage .

feminist anthropology is a four field approach to anthropology -lrb- archeological , biological , cultural , linguistic -rrb- that seeks to reduce male bias in research findings , anthropological hiring practices , and the scholarly production of knowledge . 
feminist anthropology is a four field approach to anthropology -lrb- archeological , biological , cultural , linguistic -rrb- that seeks to reduce male bias in research findings , anthropological hiring practices , and the scholarly production of knowledge . 
feminist anthropologists have claimed that their research helps to correct this systematic bias in mainstream feminist theory . 
feminist anthropologists are centrally concerned with the construction of gender across societies . 
feminist anthropology is inclusive of birth anthropology as a specialization . 
nutritional anthropology is a synthetic concept that deals with the interplay between economic systems , nutritional status and food security , and how changes in the former affect the latter . 
nutritional anthropology is a synthetic concept that deals with the interplay between economic systems , nutritional status and food security , and how changes in the former affect the latter . 
if economic and environmental changes in a community affect access to food , food security , and dietary health , then this interplay between culture and biology is in turn connected to broader historical and economic trends associated with globalization . 
nutritional status affects overall health status , work performance potential , and the overall potential for economic development -lrb- either in terms of human development or traditional western models -rrb- for any given group of people .

psychological anthropology is an interdisciplinary subfield of anthropology that studies the interaction of cultural and mental processes . 
this subfield tends to focus on ways in which humans ' development and enculturation within a particular cultural group -- with its own history , language , practices , and conceptual categories -- shape processes of human cognition , emotion , perception , motivation , and mental health .

this subfield tends to focus on ways in which humans ' development and enculturation within a particular cultural group -- with its own history , language , practices , and conceptual categories -- shape processes of human cognition , emotion , perception , motivation , and mental health . 
it also examines how the understanding of cognition , emotion , motivation , and similar psychological processes inform or constrain our models of cultural and social processes . 
cognitive anthropology seeks to explain patterns of shared knowledge , cultural innovation , and transmission over time and space using the methods and theories of the cognitive sciences -lrb- especially experimental psychology and evolutionary biology -rrb- often through close collaboration with historians , ethnographers , archaeologists , linguists , musicologists and other specialists engaged in the description and interpretation of cultural forms .

cognitive anthropology is concerned with what people from different groups know and how that implicit knowledge changes the way people perceive and relate to the world around them . 
political anthropology concerns the structure of political systems , looked at from the basis of the structure of societies .

political anthropology developed as a discipline concerned primarily with politics in stateless societies , a new development started from the 1960s , and is still unfolding : anthropologists started increasingly to study more `` complex '' social settings in which the presence of states , bureaucracies and markets entered both ethnographic accounts and analysis of local phenomena .

geertz ' comparative work on `` negara '' , the balinese state is an early , famous example . 
cyborg anthropology originated as a sub-focus group within the american anthropological association 's annual meeting in 1993 . 
cyborg anthropology originated as a sub-focus group within the american anthropological association 's annual meeting in 1993 . 
the sub-group was very closely related to sts and the society for the social studies of science . 
donna haraway 's 1985 cyborg manifesto could be considered the founding document of cyborg anthropology by first exploring the philosophical and sociological ramifications of the term . 
cyborg anthropology studies humankind and its relations with the technological systems it has built , specifically modern technological systems that have reflexively shaped notions of what it means to be human beings . 
environmental anthropology is a sub-specialty within the field of anthropology that takes an active role in examining the relationships between humans and their environment across space and time . 
the contemporary perspective of environmental anthropology , and arguably at least the backdrop , if not the focus of most of the ethnographies and cultural fieldworks of today , is political ecology . 
many characterize this new perspective as more informed with culture , politics and power , globalization , localized issues , and more . 
the focus and data interpretation is often used for arguments for/against or creation of policy , and to prevent corporate exploitation and damage of land . 
such is the case with environmental justice advocate melissa checker and her relationship with the people of hyde park . 
ethnohistory is the study of ethnographic cultures and indigenous customs by examining historical records . 
it is also the study of the history of various ethnic groups that may or may not exist today . 
ethnohistory uses both historical and ethnographic data as its foundation . 
its historical methods and materials go beyond the standard use of documents and manuscripts . 
practitioners recognize the utility of such source material as maps , music , paintings , photography , folklore , oral tradition , site exploration , archaeological materials , museum collections , enduring customs , language , and place names . 
urban anthropology is concerned with issues of urbanization , poverty , and neoliberalism . 
ulf hannerz quotes a 1960s remark that traditional anthropologists were `` a notoriously agoraphobic lot , anti-urban by definition '' . 
ulf hannerz quotes a 1960s remark that traditional anthropologists were `` a notoriously agoraphobic lot , anti-urban by definition '' . 
there are two principle approaches in urban anthropology : by examining the types of cities or examining the social issues within the cities . 
by directly looking at the different social issues , one would also be studying how they affect the dynamic of the city . 
anthrozoology -lrb- also known as `` human -- animal studies '' -rrb- is the study of interaction between living things . 
anthrozoology -lrb- also known as `` human -- animal studies '' -rrb- is the study of interaction between living things . 
it is a burgeoning interdisciplinary field that overlaps with a number of other disciplines , including anthropology , ethology , medicine , psychology , veterinary medicine and zoology . 
a major focus of anthrozoologic research is the quantifying of the positive effects of human-animal relationships on either party and the study of their interactions . 
it includes scholars from a diverse range of fields , including anthropology , sociology , biology , and philosophy . 
evolutionary anthropology is the interdisciplinary study of the evolution of human physiology and human behaviour and the relation between hominins and non-hominin primates . 
evolutionary anthropology is based in natural science and social science , combining the human development with socioeconomic factors . 
evolutionary anthropology is concerned with both biological and cultural evolution of humans , past and present . 
it is based on a scientific approach , and brings together fields such as archaeology , behavioral ecology , psychology , primatology , and genetics . 
it is a dynamic and interdisciplinary field , drawing on many lines of evidence to understand the human experience , past and present . 
ethical commitments in anthropology include noticing and documenting genocide , infanticide , racism , mutilation -lrb- including circumcision and subincision -rrb- , and torture .

topics like racism , slavery , and human sacrifice attract anthropological attention and theories ranging from nutritional deficiencies to genes to acculturation have been proposed , not to mention theories of colonialism and many others as root causes of man 's inhumanity to man . 
topics like racism , slavery , and human sacrifice attract anthropological attention and theories ranging from nutritional deficiencies to genes to acculturation have been proposed , not to mention theories of colonialism and many others as root causes of man 's inhumanity to man . 
to illustrate the depth of an anthropological approach , one can take just one of these topics , such as `` racism '' and find thousands of anthropological references , stretching across all the major and minor sub-fields .

at the same time , david h. price 's work on american anthropology during the cold war provides detailed accounts of the pursuit and dismissal of several anthropologists from their jobs for communist sympathies . 
professional anthropological bodies often object to the use of anthropology for the benefit of the state . 
their codes of ethics or statements may proscribe anthropologists from giving secret briefings . 
the association of social anthropologists of the uk and commonwealth -lrb- asa -rrb- has called certain scholarship ethically dangerous . 
the aaa 's current ` statement of professional responsibility ' clearly states that `` in relation with their own government and with host governments ... no secret research , no secret reports or debriefings of any kind should be agreed to or given . ''

on the biological or physical side , human measurements , genetic samples , nutritional data may be gathered and published as articles or monographs . 
along with dividing up their project by theoretical emphasis , anthropologists typically divide the world up into relevant time periods and geographic regions . 
human time on earth is divided up into relevant cultural traditions based on material , such as the paleolithic and the neolithic , of particular use in archaeology . 
-lsb- citation needed -rsb- further cultural subdivisions according to tool types , such as olduwan or mousterian or levalloisian help archaeologists and other anthropologists in understanding major trends in the human past . 
-lsb- citation needed -rsb- anthropologists and geographers share approaches to culture regions as well , since mapping cultures is central to both sciences . 
by making comparisons across cultural traditions -lrb- time-based -rrb- and cultural regions -lrb- space-based -rrb- , anthropologists have developed various kinds of comparative method , a central part of their science . 
some authors argue that anthropology originated and developed as the study of `` other cultures '' , both in terms of time -lrb- past societies -rrb- and space -lrb- non-european/non-western societies -rrb- .

made `` marquis of pombal '' in 1770 , he effectively ruled portugal until joseph i 's death in 1779 . 
however , historians also argue that pombal 's `` enlightenment , '' while far-reaching , was primarily a mechanism for enhancing autocracy at the expense of individual liberty and especially an apparatus for crushing opposition , suppressing criticism , and furthering colonial economic exploitation as well as intensifying book censorship and consolidating personal control and profit . 
following the távora affair , the new count of oeiras knew no opposition .

with the occupation by napoleon , portugal began a slow but inexorable decline that lasted until the 20th century . 
this decline was hastened by the independence in 1822 of the country 's largest colonial possession , brazil . 
in 1807 , as napoleon 's army closed in on lisbon , the prince regent joão vi of portugal transferred his court to brazil and established rio de janeiro as the capital of the portuguese empire . 
in 1815 , brazil was declared a kingdom and the kingdom of portugal was united with it , forming a pluricontinental state , the united kingdom of portugal , brazil and the algarves . 
with the occupation by napoleon , portugal began a slow but inexorable decline that lasted until the 20th century . 
portuguese and their allied british troops fought against the french invasion of portugal and by 1815 the situation in europe had cooled down sufficiently that joão vi would have been able to return safely to lisbon . 
however , the king of portugal remained in brazil until the liberal revolution of 1820 , which started in porto , demanded his return to lisbon in 1821 .

pelayos ' plan was to use the cantabrian mountains as a place of refuge and protection from the invading moors . 
he then aimed to regroup the iberian peninsula 's christian armies and use the cantabrian mountains as a springboard from which to regain their lands from the moors .

throughout this period , the people of county of portugal as galicians found themselves struggling to maintain the autonomy of galicia with its distinct language and culture -lrb- galician-portuguese -rrb- from the leonese culture , whenever the status of the kingdom of galicia changed in relation to the kingdom of leon . 
as a result of political division , galician-portuguese lost its unity when the county of portugal separated from the kingdom of galicia -lrb- a dependent kingdom of leon -rrb- to establish the kingdom of portugal . 
the galician and portuguese versions of the language then diverged over time as they followed independent evolutionary paths . 
this began occurring when the kingdom of leon and the kingdom of castile united and the castilian language -lrb- known as spanish -rrb- slowly over the centuries began influencing the galician language and then trying to replace it . 
the same thing happened to astur-leonese language to the point where it is greatly reduced or completely replaced by the castilian -lrb- spanish language -rrb- .

the new city centre of lisbon was designed to resist subsequent earthquakes . 
architectural models were built for tests , and the effects of an earthquake were simulated by marching troops around the models . 
despite the calamity and huge death toll , lisbon suffered no epidemics and within less than one year was already being rebuilt . 
the buildings and big squares of the pombaline city centre still remain as one of lisbon 's tourist attractions . 
sebastião de melo also made an important contribution to the study of seismology by designing an inquiry that was sent to every parish in the country .

after the 1910 revolution deposed the monarchy , the democratic but unstable portuguese first republic was established , later being superseded by the `` estado novo '' right-wing authoritarian regime . 
shortly after , independence was granted to all its colonies , with the exception of macau , which was handed over to china in 1999 . 
this marked the end of the longest-lived european colonial empire , leaving a profound cultural and architectural influence across the globe and a legacy of over 250 million portuguese speakers today . 
the name of portugal derives from the joined romano-celtic name portus cale . 
the region was settled by pre-celts and celts , giving origin to peoples like the gallaeci , lusitanians , celtici and cynetes , visited by phoenicians and carthaginians , incorporated in the roman republic dominions as lusitania and part of gallaecia , after 45 bc until 298 ad , settled again by suebi , buri , and visigoths , and conquered by moors .

there are still many ruins of castros -lrb- hill forts -rrb- all over modern portugal and remains of castro culture . 
conímbriga lies 16 km from coimbra which by its turn was the ancient aeminium -rrb- . 
after defeating the visigoths in only a few months , the umayyad caliphate started expanding rapidly in the peninsula . 
beginning in 711 , the land that is now portugal became part of the vast umayyad caliphate 's empire of damascus , which stretched from the indus river in the indian sub-continent -lrb- now pakistan -rrb- up to the south of france , until its collapse in 750 .

that year the west of the empire gained its independence under abd-ar-rahman i with the establishment of the emirate of córdoba . 
after almost two centuries , the emirate became the caliphate of córdoba in 929 , until its dissolution a century later in 1031 into no less than 23 small kingdoms , called taifa kingdoms . 
the governors of the taifas each proclaimed themselves emir of their provinces and established diplomatic relations with the christian kingdoms of the north .

most of portugal fell into the hands of the taifa of badajoz of the aftasid dynasty , and after a short spell of an ephemeral taifa of lisbon in 1022 , fell under the dominion of the taifa of seville of the abbadids poets . 
the taifa period ended with the conquest of the almoravids who came from morocco in 1086 winning a decisive victory at the battle of sagrajas , followed a century later in 1147 , after the second period of taifa , by the almohads , also from marrakesh .

the arabs were principally noblemen from oman ; and though few in numbers , they constituted the elite of the population . 
the berbers were originally from the atlas mountains and rif mountains of north africa and were essentially nomads . 
in portugal , the muslim population -lrb- or `` moors '' -rrb- , relatively small in numbers , stayed in the algarve region , and south of the tagus . 
today , there are approximately 800 words in the portuguese language of arabic origin .

before the solar/wind revolution , portugal had generated electricity from hydropower plants on its rivers for decades . 
new programs combine wind and water : wind-driven turbines pump water uphill at night , the most blustery period ; then the water flows downhill by day , generating electricity , when consumer demand is highest . 
the government aggressively encouraged such contributions by setting a premium price for those who buy rooftop-generated solar electricity .

to this end , the buddha recommended viewing things as characterized by the three marks of existence . 
impermanence -lrb- pāli : anicca -rrb- expresses the buddhist notion that all compounded or conditioned phenomena -lrb- all things and experiences -rrb- are inconstant , unsteady , and impermanent . 
according to the doctrine of impermanence , life embodies this flux in the aging process , the cycle of rebirth -lrb- saṃsāra -rrb- , and in any experience of loss . 
the doctrine asserts that because things are impermanent , attachment to them is futile and leads to suffering -lrb- dukkha -rrb- .

the word roughly corresponds to a number of terms in english including suffering , pain , unsatisfactoriness , sorrow , affliction , anxiety , dissatisfaction , discomfort , anguish , stress , misery , and frustration . 
although the term is often translated as `` suffering '' , its philosophical meaning is more analogous to `` disquietude '' as in the condition of being disturbed . 
as such , `` suffering '' is too narrow a translation with `` negative emotional connotations '' -lsb- web 9 -rsb- that can give the impression that the buddhist view is pessimistic , but buddhism seeks to be neither pessimistic nor optimistic , but realistic . 
suffering -lrb- pāli : दुक्ख dukkha ; sanskrit दुःख duḥkha -rrb- is also a central concept in buddhism .

pure land buddhism holds that it has declined to the point where few are capable of following the path , so it may be best to rely on the power of amitābha . 
bodhisattva means `` enlightenment being '' , and generally refers to one who is on the path to buddhahood . 
traditionally , a bodhisattva is anyone who , motivated by great compassion , has generated bodhicitta , which is a spontaneous wish to attain buddhahood for the benefit of all sentient beings .

according to mahayana teachings , these perfections are : dāna , śīla , kṣanti , vīrya , dhyāna , and prajñā . 
a famous saying by the 8th-century indian buddhist scholar-saint shantideva , which the 14th dalai lama often cites as his favourite verse , summarizes the bodhisattva 's intention -lrb- bodhicitta -rrb- as follows : `` for as long as space endures , and for as long as living beings remain , until then may i too abide to dispel the misery of the world .

devotion is an important part of the practice of most buddhists . 
devotional practices include bowing , offerings , pilgrimage , and chanting . 
buddhism traditionally incorporates states of meditative absorption -lrb- pali : jhāna ; skt : dhyāna -rrb- . 
the most ancient sustained expression of yogic ideas is found in the early sermons of the buddha . 
the difference between the buddha 's teaching and the yoga presented in early brahminic texts is striking . 
one key innovative teaching of the buddha was that meditative absorption must be combined with liberating cognition . 
meditation was an aspect of the practice of the yogis in the centuries preceding the buddha . 
in buddhism , mindfulness and clear awareness are to be developed at all times ; in pre-buddhist yogic practices there is no such injunction . 
religious knowledge or `` vision '' was indicated as a result of practice both within and outside of the buddhist fold . 
some of the buddha 's meditative techniques were shared with other traditions of his day , but the idea that ethics are causally related to the attainment of `` transcendent wisdom '' -lrb- pali paññā ; skt .

the buddhist texts are probably the earliest describing meditation techniques . 
two upanishads written after the rise of buddhism do contain full-fledged descriptions of yoga as a means to liberation . 
while there is no convincing evidence for meditation in pre-buddhist early brahminic texts , wynne argues that formless meditation originated in the brahminic or shramanic tradition , based on strong parallels between upanishadic cosmological statements and the meditative goals of the two teachers of the buddha as recorded in the early buddhist texts . 
having argued that the cosmological statements in the upanishads also reflect a contemplative tradition , he argues that the nasadiya sukta contains evidence for a contemplative tradition , even as early as the late rig vedic period .

traditionally , the first step in most buddhist schools requires taking refuge in the three jewels -lrb- sanskrit : tri-ratna , pāli : ti-ratana -rrb- -lsb- web 19 -rsb- as the foundation of one 's religious practice . 
the practice of taking refuge on behalf of young or even unborn children is mentioned in the majjhima nikaya , recognized by most scholars as an early text -lrb- cf. infant baptism -rrb- . 
tibetan buddhism sometimes adds a fourth refuge , in the lama . 
just as real jewels never change their faculty and goodness , whether praised or reviled , so are the three jewels -lrb- refuges -rrb- , because they have an eternal and immutable essence . 
in mahayana , too , the three jewels are perceived as possessed of an eternal and unchanging essence and as having an irreversible effect : `` the three jewels have the quality of excellence . 
according to the scriptures , gautama buddha presented himself as a model . 
the dharma offers a refuge by providing guidelines for the alleviation of suffering and the attainment of nirvana . 
the sangha is considered to provide a refuge by preserving the authentic teachings of the buddha and providing further examples that the truth of the buddha 's teachings is attainable . 
śīla -lrb- sanskrit -rrb- or sīla -lrb- pāli -rrb- is usually translated into english as `` virtuous behavior '' , `` morality '' , `` moral discipline '' , `` ethics '' or `` precept '' . 
it is one of the three practices -lrb- sīla , samādhi , and paññā -rrb- and the second pāramitā . 
according to the law of karma , keeping the precepts is meritorious and it acts as causes that would bring about peaceful and happy effects . 
śīla is the foundation of samādhi / bhāvana -lrb- meditative cultivation -rrb- or mind cultivation . 
according to the law of karma , keeping the precepts is meritorious and it acts as causes that would bring about peaceful and happy effects . 
śīla refers to overall principles of ethical behavior . 
there are several levels of sīla , which correspond to `` basic morality '' -lrb- five precepts -rrb- , `` basic morality with asceticism '' -lrb- eight precepts -rrb- , `` novice monkhood '' -lrb- ten precepts -rrb- and `` monkhood '' -lrb- vinaya or patimokkha -rrb- . 
if they wish , they can choose to undertake the eight precepts , which add basic asceticism . 
the precepts are not formulated as imperatives , but as training rules that laypeople undertake voluntarily to facilitate practice . 
in buddhist thought , the cultivation of dana and ethical conduct themselves refine consciousness to such a level that rebirth in one of the lower heavens is likely , even if there is no further buddhist practice .

at the same time , these movements were influenced by , and in some respects continued , philosophical thought within the vedic tradition as reflected e.g. in the upanishads . 
these movements included , besides buddhism , various skeptics -lrb- such as sanjaya belatthiputta -rrb- , atomists -lrb- such as pakudha kaccayana -rrb- , materialists -lrb- such as ajita kesakambali -rrb- , antinomians -lrb- such as purana kassapa -rrb- ; the most important ones in the 5th century bce were the ajivikas , who emphasized the rule of fate , the lokayata -lrb- materialists -rrb- , the ajnanas -lrb- agnostics -rrb- and the jains , who stressed that the soul must be freed from matter .

a particular criticism of the buddha was vedic animal sacrifice . 
-lsb- web 18 -rsb- he also mocked the vedic `` hymn of the cosmic man '' . 
he names the vedic rishis , and declared that the original veda of the rishis -lsb- note 25 -rsb- was altered by a few brahmins who introduced animal sacrifices . 
the buddha says that it was on this alteration of the true veda that he refused to pay respect to the vedas of his time . 
-lsb- note 27 -rsb- the reliability of these sources , and the possibility to draw out a core of oldest teachings , is a matter of dispute . 
a core problem in the study of early buddhism is the relation between dhyana and insight . 
schmithausen , in his often-cited article on some aspects of descriptions or theories of ` liberating insight ' and ` enlightenment ' in early buddhism notes that the mention of the four noble truths as constituting `` liberating insight '' , which is attained after mastering the rupa jhanas , is a later addition to texts such as majjhima nikaya 36 .

schmithausen is a notable scholar who has questioned whether karma already played a role in the theory of rebirth of earliest buddhism . 
bruce matthews notes that there is no cohesive presentation of karma in the sutta pitaka , which may mean that the doctrine was incidental to the main perspective of early buddhist soteriology .

pre-sectarian buddhism is the earliest phase of buddhism , recognized by nearly all scholars . 
certain basic teachings appear in many places throughout the early texts , so most scholars conclude that gautama buddha must have taught something similar to the three marks of existence , the five aggregates , dependent origination , karma and rebirth , the four noble truths , the noble eightfold path , and nirvana .

according to the scriptures , soon after the parinirvāṇa -lrb- from sanskrit : `` highest extinguishment '' -rrb- of gautama buddha , the first buddhist council was held .

according to most scholars , at some period after the second council the sangha began to break into separate factions . 
according to the dipavamsa of the pāli tradition , they started immediately after the second council , the puggalavada tradition places it in 137 an , the sarvastivada tradition of vasumitra says it was in the time of ashoka and the mahasanghika tradition places it much later , nearly 100 bce . 
this contradicts the mahasanghikas ' own vinaya , which shows them as on the same , winning side . 
the dipavamsa of the theravāda says that the losing party in the second council dispute broke away in protest and formed the mahasanghika . 
the mahāsāṅghikas argued that the sthaviras were trying to expand the vinaya and may also have challenged what they perceived were excessive claims or inhumanly high criteria for arhatship . 
the sthaviras gave rise to several schools , one of which was the theravāda school . 
originally , these schisms were caused by disputes over vinaya , and monks following different schools of thought seem to have lived happily together in the same monasteries , but eventually , by about 100 ce if not earlier , schisms were being caused by doctrinal disagreements too . 
originally , these schisms were caused by disputes over vinaya , and monks following different schools of thought seem to have lived happily together in the same monasteries , but eventually , by about 100 ce if not earlier , schisms were being caused by doctrinal disagreements too . 
following -lrb- or leading up to -rrb- the schisms , each saṅgha started to accumulate an abhidharma , a detailed scholastic reworking of doctrinal material appearing in the suttas , according to schematic classifications . 
these abhidharma texts do not contain systematic philosophical treatises , but summaries or numerical lists . 
scholars generally date these texts to around the 3rd century bce , 100 to 200 years after the death of the buddha . 
scholars disagree on whether the mahasanghika school had an abhidhamma pitaka or not .

they note that the ancient buddhist sites in the lower kṛṣṇa valley , including amaravati , nāgārjunakoṇḍā and jaggayyapeṭa `` can be traced to at least the third century bce , if not earlier . '' 
akira hirakawa notes the `` evidence suggests that many early mahayana scriptures originated in south india . '' 
there is no evidence that mahāyāna ever referred to a separate formal school or sect of buddhism , but rather that it existed as a certain set of ideals , and later doctrines , for bodhisattvas . 
paul williams has also noted that the mahāyāna never had nor ever attempted to have a separate vinaya or ordination lineage from the early schools of buddhism , and therefore each bhikṣu or bhikṣuṇī adhering to the mahāyāna formally belonged to an early school . 
from chinese monks visiting india , we now know that both mahāyāna and non-mahāyāna monks in india often lived in the same monasteries side by side . 
much of the early extant evidence for the origins of mahāyāna comes from early chinese translations of mahāyāna texts . 
these mahāyāna teachings were first propagated into china by lokakṣema , the first translator of mahāyāna sūtras into chinese during the 2nd century ce .

seven million additional buddhists are found outside of asia . 
according to johnson and grim -lrb- 2013 -rrb- , buddhism has grown from a total of 138 million adherents in 1910 , of which 137 million were in asia , to 495 million in 2010 , of which 487 million are in asia .

hinayana -lrb- literally `` lesser vehicle '' -rrb- is used by mahayana followers to name the family of early philosophical schools and traditions from which contemporary theravada emerged , but as this term is rooted in the mahayana viewpoint and can be considered derogatory , a variety of other terms are increasingly used instead , including śrāvakayāna , nikaya buddhism , early buddhist schools , sectarian buddhism , conservative buddhism , mainstream buddhism and non-mahayana buddhism .

not all traditions of buddhism share the same philosophical outlook , or treat the same concepts as central . 
for example , according to one buddhist ecumenical organization , -lsb- web 23 -rsb- several concepts common to both major buddhist branches : 
theravada -lrb- `` doctrine of the elders '' , or `` ancient doctrine '' -rrb- is the oldest surviving buddhist school . 
the name theravāda comes from the ancestral sthāvirīya , one of the early buddhist schools , from which the theravadins claim descent . 
sinhalese buddhist reformers in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries portrayed the pali canon as the original version of scripture . 
it has a growing presence in the west . 
theravadin buddhists believe that personal effort is required to realize rebirth . 
laypersons can perform good actions , producing merit . 
mahāyāna centres of learning were established , the most important one being the nālandā university in north-eastern india . 
mahayana schools recognize all or part of the mahayana sutras . 
some of these sutras became for mahayanists a manifestation of the buddha himself , and faith in and veneration of those texts are stated in some sutras -lrb- e.g. the lotus sutra and the mahaparinirvana sutra -rrb- to lay the foundations for the later attainment of buddhahood itself .

native mahayana buddhism is practiced today in china , japan , korea , singapore , parts of russia and most of vietnam -lrb- also commonly referred to as `` eastern buddhism '' -rrb- . 
the buddhism practiced in tibet , the himalayan regions , and mongolia is also mahayana in origin , but is discussed below under the heading of vajrayana -lrb- also commonly referred to as `` northern buddhism '' -rrb- . 
there are a variety of strands in eastern buddhism , of which `` the pure land school of mahayana is the most widely practised today . '' 
various classes of vajrayana literature developed as a result of royal courts sponsoring both buddhism and saivism . 
the mañjusrimulakalpa , which later came to classified under kriyatantra , states that mantras taught in the saiva , garuda and vaisnava tantras will be effective if applied by buddhists since they were all taught originally by manjushri . 
the guhyasiddhi of padmavajra , a work associated with the guhyasamaja tradition , prescribes acting as a saiva guru and initiating members into saiva siddhanta scriptures and mandalas . 
buddhist scriptures and other texts exist in great variety . 
some schools venerate certain texts as religious objects in themselves , while others take a more scholastic approach . 
unlike many religions , buddhism has no single central text that is universally referred to by all traditions . 
the tibetan buddhists have not even translated most of the āgamas -lrb- though theoretically they recognize them -rrb- and they play no part in the religious life of either clergy or laity in china and japan . 
however , some scholars have referred to the vinaya pitaka and the first four nikayas of the sutta pitaka as the common core of all buddhist traditions . 
the size and complexity of the buddhist canons have been seen by some -lrb- including buddhist social reformer babasaheb ambedkar -rrb- as presenting barriers to the wider understanding of buddhist philosophy . 
later in sri lanka , the dhammapada was championed as a unifying scripture . 
over the years , various attempts have been made to synthesize a single buddhist text that can encompass all of the major principles of buddhism . 
in the theravada tradition , condensed ` study texts ' were created that combined popular or influential scriptures into single volumes that could be studied by novice monks . 
dwight goddard collected a sample of buddhist scriptures , with the emphasis on zen , along with other classics of eastern philosophy , such as the tao te ching , into his ` buddhist bible ' in the 1920s . 
more recently , dr. babasaheb ambedkar attempted to create a single , combined document of buddhist principles in `` the buddha and his dhamma '' . 
the pāli tipitaka , which means `` three baskets '' , refers to the vinaya pitaka , the sutta pitaka , and the abhidhamma pitaka .

the pāli tipitaka , which means `` three baskets '' , refers to the vinaya pitaka , the sutta pitaka , and the abhidhamma pitaka . 
the pāli tipitaka is the only early tipitaka -lrb- sanskrit : tripiṭaka -rrb- to survive intact in its original language , but a number of early schools had their own recensions of the tipitaka featuring much of the same material . 
according to some sources , some early schools of buddhism had five or seven pitakas . 
according to the scriptures , soon after the death of the buddha , the first buddhist council was held ; a monk named mahākāśyapa -lrb- pāli : mahākassapa -rrb- presided . 
the goal of the council was to record the buddha 's teachings . 
upāli recited the vinaya . 
ānanda , the buddha 's personal attendant , was called upon to recite the dhamma . 
ānanda , the buddha 's personal attendant , was called upon to recite the dhamma . 
much of the material in the canon is not specifically `` theravadin '' , but is instead the collection of teachings that this school preserved from the early , non-sectarian body of teachings . 
he states : `` the theravadins , then , may have added texts to the canon for some time , but they do not appear to have tampered with what they already had from an earlier period . '' 
the mahayana sutras are a very broad genre of buddhist scriptures that the mahayana buddhist tradition holds are original teachings of the buddha .

some adherents of mahayana accept both the early teachings -lrb- including in this the sarvastivada abhidharma , which was criticized by nagarjuna and is in fact opposed to early buddhist thought -rrb- and the mahayana sutras as authentic teachings of gautama buddha , and claim they were designed for different types of persons and different levels of spiritual understanding . 
the mahayana sutras often claim to articulate the buddha 's deeper , more advanced doctrines , reserved for those who follow the bodhisattva path . 
hence the name mahāyāna -lrb- lit. , the great vehicle -rrb- .

according to mahayana tradition , the mahayana sutras were transmitted in secret , came from other buddhas or bodhisattvas , or were preserved in non-human worlds because human beings at the time could not understand them :

according to mahayana tradition , the mahayana sutras were transmitted in secret , came from other buddhas or bodhisattvas , or were preserved in non-human worlds because human beings at the time could not understand them : 
approximately six hundred mahayana sutras have survived in sanskrit or in chinese or tibetan translations . 
in addition , east asian buddhism recognizes some sutras regarded by scholars as of chinese rather than indian origin . 
it was not until after the 5th century ce that the mahayana sutras started to influence the behavior of mainstream buddhists in india : `` but outside of texts , at least in india , at exactly the same period , very different -- in fact seemingly older -- ideas and aspirations appear to be motivating actual behavior , and old and established hinnayana groups appear to be the only ones that are patronized and supported . '' 
these texts were apparently not universally accepted among indian buddhists when they appeared ; the pejorative label hinayana was applied by mahayana supporters to those who rejected the mahayana sutras . 
only the theravada school does not include the mahayana scriptures in its canon . 
as the modern theravada school is descended from a branch of buddhism that diverged and established itself in sri lanka prior to the emergence of the mahayana texts , debate exists as to whether the theravada were historically included in the hinayana designation ; in the modern era , this label is seen as derogatory , and is generally avoided .

jonathan silk has argued that the term `` hinayana '' was used to refer to whomever one wanted to criticize on any given occasion , and did not refer to any definite grouping of buddhists . 
she notes that the term śrāvakayāna was `` the more politically correct and much more usual '' term used by mahāyānists . 
buddhism provides many opportunities for comparative study with a diverse range of subjects . 
for example , buddhism 's emphasis on the middle way not only provides a unique guideline for ethics but has also allowed buddhism to peacefully coexist with various differing beliefs , customs and institutions in countries where it has resided throughout its history . 
also , its moral and spiritual parallels with other systems of thought -- for example , with various tenets of christianity -- have been subjects of close study .

in addition , the buddhist concept of dependent origination has been compared to modern scientific thought , as well as western metaphysics . 
there are differences of opinion on the question of whether or not buddhism should be considered a religion .

all five of these albums reached the top ten in billboard 200 which made then american idol the most successful soundtrack franchise of any motion picture or television program . 
in season seven the live performances and studio recordings were made available during the season from itunes when it joined as a sponsor . 
19 recordings , a recording label owned by 19 entertainment , currently hold the rights to phonographic material recorded by all the contestants . 
sony music was partnered with american idol and distribute its music , and in 2010 , sony was replaced by as the music label for american idol by umg 's interscope-geffen-a & m records . 
19 originally partnered with bertelsmann music group -lrb- bmg -rrb- to promote and distribute the recordings through its labels rca records , arista records , j records , jive records .

dog behavior is the internally coordinated responses -lrb- actions or inactions -rrb- of the domestic dog -lrb- individuals or groups -rrb- to internal and/or external stimuli . 
as a result of this physical and social evolution , dogs , more than any other species , have acquired the ability to understand and communicate with humans and they are uniquely attuned to our behaviors . 
rather , these skills parallel some of the social-cognitive skills of human children . 
dog communication is about how dogs `` speak '' to each other , how they understand messages that humans send to them , and how humans can translate the ideas that dogs are trying to transmit. : xii these communication behaviors include eye gaze , facial expression , vocalization , body posture -lrb- including movements of bodies and limbs -rrb- and gustatory communication -lrb- scents , pheromones and taste -rrb- .

despite their close genetic relationship and the ability to inter-breed , there are a number of diagnostic features to distinguish the gray wolves from domestic dogs . 
dogs lack a functioning pre-caudal gland , and most enter estrus twice yearly , unlike gray wolves which only do so once a year . 
unlike other domestic species which were primarily selected for production-related traits , dogs were initially selected for their behaviors . 
in 2016 , a study found that there were only 11 fixed genes that showed variation between wolves and dogs . 
these gene variations were unlikely to have been the result of natural evolution , and indicate selection on both morphology and behavior during dog domestication . 
these genes have been shown to have an impact on the catecholamine synthesis pathway , with the majority of the genes affecting the fight-or-flight response -lrb- i.e. selection for tameness -rrb- , and emotional processing . 
dogs generally show reduced fear and aggression compared to wolves .

despite their descent from wolves and classification as carnivora , dogs are variously described in scholarly and other writings as carnivores or omnivores . 
dogs will healthily digest a variety of foods , including vegetables and grains , and can consume a large proportion of these in their diet . 
unlike obligate carnivores , such as the cat family with its shorter small intestine , dogs can adapt to a wide-ranging diet , and are not dependent on meat-specific protein nor a very high level of protein in order to fulfill their basic dietary requirements .

it is generally accepted that kurt gödel 's incompleteness theorem of 1931 definitively demonstrated that for any set of axioms and inference rules proposed to encapsulate mathematics , there would in fact be some truths of mathematics which could not be deduced from them , and hence that principia mathematica could never achieve its aims .

the essay from which aims of education derived its name was delivered as an address in 1916 when whitehead was president of the london branch of the mathematical association . 
in it , he cautioned against the teaching of what he called `` inert ideas '' -- ideas that are disconnected scraps of information , with no application to real life or culture . 
he opined that `` education with inert ideas is not only useless : it is , above all things , harmful . '' 
whitehead 's most complete work on education is the 1929 book the aims of education and other essays , which collected numerous essays and addresses by whitehead on the subject published between 1912 and 1927 .

in fact , he never had any formal training in philosophy beyond his undergraduate education . 
in one letter to his friend and former student bertrand russell , after discussing whether science aimed to be explanatory or merely descriptive , he wrote : `` this further question lands us in the ocean of metaphysic , onto which my profound ignorance of that science forbids me to enter . '' 
ironically , in later life whitehead would become one of the 20th century 's foremost metaphysicians .

early in his life he showed great interest in and respect for philosophy and metaphysics , but it is evident that he considered himself a rank amateur . 
ironically , in later life whitehead would become one of the 20th century 's foremost metaphysicians . 
in the notes of one his students for a 1927 class , whitehead was quoted as saying : `` every scientific man in order to preserve his reputation has to say he dislikes metaphysics . 
in whitehead 's view , scientists and philosophers make metaphysical assumptions about how the universe works all the time , but such assumptions are not easily seen precisely because they remain unexamined and unquestioned . 
while whitehead acknowledged that `` philosophers can never hope finally to formulate these metaphysical first principles , '' he argued that people need to continually re-imagine their basic assumptions about how the universe works if philosophy and science are to make any real progress , even if that progress remains permanently asymptotic . 
for this reason whitehead regarded metaphysical investigations as essential to both good science and good philosophy .

for this reason whitehead regarded metaphysical investigations as essential to both good science and good philosophy . 
perhaps foremost among what whitehead considered faulty metaphysical assumptions was the cartesian idea that reality is fundamentally constructed of bits of matter that exist totally independently of one another , which he rejected in favor of an event-based or `` process '' ontology in which events are primary and are fundamentally interrelated and dependent on one another .

he used the term `` experience '' very broadly , so that even inanimate processes such as electron collisions are said to manifest some degree of experience . 
in this , he went against descartes ' separation of two different kinds of real existence , either exclusively material or else exclusively mental . 
whitehead referred to his metaphysical system as `` philosophy of organism '' , but it would become known more widely as `` process philosophy . ''

whitehead referred to his metaphysical system as `` philosophy of organism '' , but it would become known more widely as `` process philosophy . '' 
by assuming that enduring objects are the most real and fundamental things in the universe , materialists have mistaken the abstract for the concrete -lrb- what whitehead calls the `` fallacy of misplaced concreteness '' -rrb- . 
in whitehead 's view , then , concepts such as `` quality '' , `` matter '' , and `` form '' are problematic . 
these `` classical '' concepts fail to adequately account for change , and overlook the active and experiential nature of the most basic elements of the world . 
what is ordinarily conceived of as a single person , for instance , is philosophically described as a continuum of overlapping events . 
these occasions of experience are logically distinct , but are progressively connected in what whitehead calls a `` society '' of events .

these occasions of experience are logically distinct , but are progressively connected in what whitehead calls a `` society '' of events . 
what is ordinarily conceived of as a single person , for instance , is philosophically described as a continuum of overlapping events . 
but in whitehead 's cosmology , the only fundamentally existent things are discrete `` occasions of experience '' that overlap one another in time and space , and jointly make up the enduring person or thing . 
to put it another way , a thing or person is often seen as having a `` defining essence '' or a `` core identity '' that is unchanging , and describes what the thing or person really is . 
in this way of thinking , things and people are seen as fundamentally the same through time , with any changes being qualitative and secondary to their core identity -lrb- e.g. `` mark 's hair has turned gray as he has gotten older , but he is still the same person '' -rrb- .

but in whitehead 's cosmology , the only fundamentally existent things are discrete `` occasions of experience '' that overlap one another in time and space , and jointly make up the enduring person or thing . 
everything changes from moment to moment , and to think of anything as having an `` enduring essence '' misses the fact that `` all things flow '' , though it is often a useful way of speaking . 
identities do not define people , people define identities . 
after all , each moment of each person 's life can hardly be given a different proper name , and it is easy and convenient to think of people and objects as remaining fundamentally the same things , rather than constantly keeping in mind that each thing is a different thing from what it was a moment ago . 
yet the limitations of everyday living and everyday speech should not prevent people from realizing that `` material substances '' or `` essences '' are a convenient generalized description of a continuum of particular , concrete processes . 
whitehead pointed to the limitations of language as one of the main culprits in maintaining a materialistic way of thinking , and acknowledged that it may be difficult to ever wholly move past such ideas in everyday speech . 
no one questions that a ten-year-old person is quite different by the time he or she turns thirty years old , and in many ways is not the same person at all ; whitehead points out that it is not philosophically or ontologically sound to think that a person is the same from one second to the next .

each object is simply an inert clump of matter that is only externally related to other things . 
the idea of matter as primary makes people think of objects as being fundamentally separate in time and space , and not necessarily related to anything . 
but in whitehead 's view , relations take a primary role , perhaps even more important than the relata themselves . 
it sees every object as distinct and discrete from all other objects . 
a second problem with materialism is that it obscures the importance of relations .

each object is simply an inert clump of matter that is only externally related to other things . 
in fact , whitehead describes any entity as in some sense nothing more and nothing less than the sum of its relations to other entities -- its synthesis of and reaction to the world around it . 
a real thing is just that which forces the rest of the universe to in some way conform to it ; that is to say , if theoretically a thing made strictly no difference to any other entity -lrb- i.e. it was not related to any other entity -rrb- , it could not be said to really exist .

indeed , in recent decades attention to whitehead 's work has become more widespread , with interest extending to intellectuals in europe and china , and coming from such diverse fields as ecology , physics , biology , education , economics , and psychology . 
one of the first theologians to attempt to interact with whitehead 's thought was the future archbishop of canterbury , william temple . 
in temple 's gifford lectures of 1932-1934 -lrb- subsequently published as `` nature , man and god '' -rrb- , whitehead is one of a number of philosophers of the emergent evolution approach temple interacts with . 
isabelle stengers wrote that `` whiteheadians are recruited among both philosophers and theologians , and the palette has been enriched by practitioners from the most diverse horizons , from ecology to feminism , practices that unite political struggle and spirituality with the sciences of education .

they taught generations of whitehead scholars , the most notable of which is john b. cobb , jr. . 
professors such as wieman , charles hartshorne , bernard loomer , bernard meland , and daniel day williams made whitehead 's philosophy arguably the most important intellectual thread running through the divinity school . 
but while claremont remains the most concentrated hub of whiteheadian activity , the place where whitehead 's thought currently seems to be growing the most quickly is in china . 
in order to address the challenges of modernization and industrialization , china has begun to blend traditions of taoism , buddhism , and confucianism with whitehead 's `` constructive post-modern '' philosophy in order to create an `` ecological civilization . ''

to date , the chinese government has encouraged the building of twenty-three university-based centers for the study of whitehead 's philosophy , and books by process philosophers john cobb and david ray griffin are becoming required reading for chinese graduate students . 
cobb has attributed china 's interest in process philosophy partly to whitehead 's stress on the mutual interdependence of humanity and nature , as well as his emphasis on an educational system that includes the teaching of values rather than simply bare facts . 
it is impossible to say exactly why whitehead 's influence has not been more widespread , but it may be partly due to his metaphysical ideas seeming somewhat counter-intuitive -lrb- such as his assertion that matter is an abstraction -rrb- , or his inclusion of theistic elements in his philosophy , or the perception of metaphysics itself as passé , or simply the sheer difficulty and density of his prose .

deleuze 's and latour 's opinions , however , are minority ones , as whitehead has not been recognized as particularly influential within the most dominant philosophical schools . 
one philosophical school which has historically had a close relationship with process philosophy is american pragmatism . 
whitehead himself thought highly of william james and john dewey , and acknowledged his indebtedness to them in the preface to process and reality . 
today , nicholas rescher is one example of a philosopher who advocates both process philosophy and pragmatism . 
charles hartshorne -lrb- along with paul weiss -rrb- edited the collected papers of charles sanders peirce , one of the founders of pragmatism . 
noted neopragmatist richard rorty was in turn a student of hartshorne . 
it has been severely criticized . 
henry stapp and david bohm are among those whose work has been influenced by whitehead . 
whitehead 's view has now been rendered obsolete , with the discovery of gravitational waves . 
they are phenonena observed locally that largely violate the kind of local flatness of space that whitehead assumes . 
consequently , whitehead 's cosmology must be regarded as a local approximation , and his assumption of a uniform spatio-temporal geometry , minkowskian in particular , as an often-locally-adequate approximation . 
cobb also co-authored a book with economist herman daly entitled for the common good : redirecting the economy toward community , the environment , and a sustainable future -lrb- 1989 -rrb- , which applied whitehead 's thought to economics , and received the grawemeyer award for ideas improving world order .

cobb followed this with a second book , sustaining the common good : a christian perspective on the global economy -lrb- 1994 -rrb- , which aimed to challenge `` economists ' zealous faith in the great god of growth . ''

another model is the feels model developed by xie bangxiu and deployed successfully in china . 
`` feels '' stands for five things in curriculum and education : flexible-goals , engaged-learner , embodied-knowledge , learning-through-interactions , and supportive-teacher . 
it is used for understanding and evaluating educational curriculum under the assumption that the purpose of education is to `` help a person become whole . '' 
this work is in part the product of cooperation between chinese government organizations and the institute for the postmodern development of china . 
one of the leading figures having an explicitly whiteheadian and panexperientialist stance towards management is mark dibben , who works in what he calls `` applied process thought '' to articulate a philosophy of management and business administration as part of a wider examination of the social sciences through the lens of process metaphysics .

dibben has published two books on applied process thought , applied process thought i : initial explorations in theory and research -lrb- 2008 -rrb- , and applied process thought ii : following a trail ablaze -lrb- 2009 -rrb- , as well as other papers in this vein in the fields of philosophy of management and business ethics . 
whitehead has had some influence on philosophy of business administration and organizational theory . 
for dibben , this allows `` a comprehensive exploration of life as perpetually active experiencing , as opposed to occasional -- and thoroughly passive -- happening . ''

the two volume biography of whitehead by victor lowe is the most definitive presentation of the life of whitehead . 
however , many details of whitehead 's life remain obscure because he left no nachlass ; his family carried out his instructions that all of his papers be destroyed after his death . 
additionally , whitehead was known for his `` almost fanatical belief in the right to privacy '' , and for writing very few personal letters of the kind that would help to gain insight on his life . 
this led to lowe himself remarking on the first page of whitehead 's biography , `` no professional biographer in his right mind would touch him . ''

for whitehead , creativity is the absolute principle of existence , and every entity -lrb- whether it is a human being , a tree , or an electron -rrb- has some degree of novelty in how it responds to other entities , and is not fully determined by causal or mechanistic laws . 
it must be emphasized , however , that an entity is not merely a sum of its relations , but also a valuation of them and reaction to them . 
of course , most entities do not have consciousness . 
moreover , inability to predict an electron 's movement -lrb- for instance -rrb- is not due to faulty understanding or inadequate technology ; rather , the fundamental creativity/freedom of all entities means that there will always remain phenomena that are unpredictable .

the term is meant to indicate a kind of perception that can be conscious or unconscious , applying to people as well as electrons . 
further , whitehead regards perception as occurring in two modes , causal efficacy -lrb- or `` physical prehension '' -rrb- and presentational immediacy -lrb- or `` conceptual prehension '' -rrb- . 
the term is meant to indicate a kind of perception that can be conscious or unconscious , applying to people as well as electrons . 
in this way , entities are constituted by their perceptions and relations , rather than being independent of them . 
further , whitehead regards perception as occurring in two modes , causal efficacy -lrb- or `` physical prehension '' -rrb- and presentational immediacy -lrb- or `` conceptual prehension '' -rrb- . 
it is , in other words , the sense of causal relations between entities , a feeling of being influenced and affected by the surrounding environment , unmediated by the senses . 
in other words , it is pure appearance , which may or may not be delusive -lrb- e.g. mistaking an image in a mirror for `` the real thing '' -rrb- . 
whitehead describes causal efficacy as `` the experience dominating the primitive living organisms , which have a sense for the fate from which they have emerged , and the fate towards which they go . '' 
presentational immediacy , on the other hand , is what is usually referred to as `` pure sense perception '' , unmediated by any causal or symbolic interpretation , even unconscious interpretation .

in higher organisms -lrb- like people -rrb- , these two modes of perception combine into what whitehead terms `` symbolic reference '' , which links appearance with causation in a process that is so automatic that both people and animals have difficulty refraining from it .

an ordinary person looks up , sees a colored shape , and immediately infers that it is a chair . 
however , an artist , whitehead supposes , `` might not have jumped to the notion of a chair '' , but instead `` might have stopped at the mere contemplation of a beautiful color and a beautiful shape . '' 
using the same example , whitehead points out that a dog `` would have acted immediately on the hypothesis of a chair and would have jumped onto it by way of using it as such . '' 
whitehead makes the startling observation that `` life is comparatively deficient in survival value . '' 
he then observes that the mark of higher forms of life is that they are actively engaged in modifying their environment , an activity which he theorizes is directed toward the three-fold goal of living , living well , and living better .

in other words , whitehead sees life as directed toward the purpose of increasing its own satisfaction . 
without such a goal , he sees the rise of life as totally unintelligible . 
if humans can only exist for about a hundred years , and rocks for eight hundred million , then one is forced to ask why complex organisms ever evolved in the first place ; as whitehead humorously notes , `` they certainly did not appear because they were better at that game than the rocks around them . '' 
as opposed to the most widely accepted forms of christianity , whitehead emphasized an idea of god that he called `` the brief galilean vision of humility '' : 
perhaps his most famous and pointed criticism of the christian conception of god is that `` the church gave unto god the attributes which belonged exclusively to caesar . '' 
here whitehead is criticizing christianity for defining god as primarily a divine king who imposes his will on the world , and whose most important attribute is power . 
it should be emphasized , however , that for whitehead god is not necessarily tied to religion . 
whitehead posited that these ordered potentials exist in what he called the primordial nature of god . 
this led him to reflect more intensively on what he saw as the second nature of god , the consequent nature . 
whitehead 's conception of god as a `` dipolar '' entity has called for fresh theological thinking . 
his system required that an order exist among possibilities , an order that allowed for novelty in the world and provided an aim to all entities . 
god 's consequent nature , on the other hand , is anything but unchanging -- it is god 's reception of the world 's activity . 
in other words , god saves and cherishes all experiences forever , and those experiences go on to change the way god interacts with the world . 
it is the judgment of a tenderness which loses nothing that can be saved . '' 
in other words , god saves and cherishes all experiences forever , and those experiences go on to change the way god interacts with the world . 
in this way , god is really changed by what happens in the world and the wider universe , lending the actions of finite creatures an eternal significance . 
on the other hand , he sees god as permanent but as deficient in actuality and change : alone , god is merely eternally unrealized possibilities , and requires the world to actualize them . 
on the other hand , he sees god as permanent but as deficient in actuality and change : alone , god is merely eternally unrealized possibilities , and requires the world to actualize them . 
whitehead thus sees god and the world as fulfilling one another . 
he sees entities in the world as fluent and changing things that yearn for a permanence which only god can provide by taking them into god 's self , thereafter changing god and affecting the rest of the universe throughout time . 
he sees entities in the world as fluent and changing things that yearn for a permanence which only god can provide by taking them into god 's self , thereafter changing god and affecting the rest of the universe throughout time . 
for whitehead the core of religion was individual . 
his most famous remark on religion is that `` religion is what the individual does with his own solitariness ... and if you are never solitary , you are never religious . '' 
whitehead saw religion as a system of general truths that transformed a person 's character . 
he took special care to note that while religion is often a good influence , it is not necessarily good -- an idea which he called a `` dangerous delusion '' -lrb- e.g. , a religion might encourage the violent extermination of a rival religion 's adherents -rrb- . 
however , while whitehead saw religion as beginning in solitariness , he also saw religion as necessarily expanding beyond the individual . 
in keeping with his process metaphysics in which relations are primary , he wrote that religion necessitates the realization of `` the value of the objective world which is a community derivative from the interrelations of its component individuals . '' 
in other words , the universe is a community which makes itself whole through the relatedness of each individual entity to all the others -- meaning and value do not exist for the individual alone , but only in the context of the universal community . 
the spirit at once surrenders itself to this universal claim and appropriates it for itself . '' 
in this way the individual and universal/social aspects of religion are mutually dependent . 
outside of these circles his influence is relatively small and diffuse , and has tended to come chiefly through the work of his students and admirers rather than whitehead himself . 
french sociologist and anthropologist bruno latour even went so far as to call whitehead `` the greatest philosopher of the 20th century . '' 
in english-speaking countries , his primary works are little-studied outside of claremont and a select number of liberal graduate-level theology and philosophy programs . 
for instance , whitehead was a teacher and long-time friend and collaborator of bertrand russell , and he also taught and supervised the dissertation of willard van orman quine , both of whom are important figures in analytic philosophy -- the dominant strain of philosophy in english-speaking countries in the 20th century . 
whitehead has also had high-profile admirers in the continental tradition , such as french post-structuralist philosopher gilles deleuze , who once dryly remarked of whitehead that `` he stands provisionally as the last great anglo-american philosopher before wittgenstein 's disciples spread their misty confusion , sufficiency , and terror . '' 
historically whitehead 's work has been most influential in the field of american progressive theology . 
the most important early proponent of whitehead 's thought in a theological context was charles hartshorne , who spent a semester at harvard as whitehead 's teaching assistant in 1925 , and is widely credited with developing whitehead 's process philosophy into a full-blown process theology .

other notable process theologians include john b. cobb , jr. , david ray griffin , marjorie hewitt suchocki , c. robert mesle , roland faber , and catherine keller . 
process theology typically stresses god 's relational nature . 
rather than seeing god as impassive or emotionless , process theologians view god as `` the fellow sufferer who understands '' , and as the being who is supremely affected by temporal events . 
hartshorne points out that people would not praise a human ruler who was unaffected by either the joys or sorrows of his followers -- so why would this be a praise-worthy quality in god ? 
instead , as the being who is most affected by the world , god is the being who can most appropriately respond to the world . 
c. robert mesle , for instance , advocates a `` process naturalism '' , i.e. a process theology without god . 
john b. cobb , jr. is a process theologian who has also written books on biology and economics . 
roland faber and catherine keller integrate whitehead with poststructuralist , postcolonialist , and feminist theory . 
charles birch was both a theologian and a geneticist . 
in syntheism - creating god in the internet age , futurologists alexander bard and jan söderqvist repeatedly credit whitehead for the process theology they see rising out of the participatory culture expected to dominate the digital era . 
in fact , process theology is difficult to define because process theologians are so diverse and transdisciplinary in their views and interests . 
whitehead also described religion more technically as `` an ultimate craving to infuse into the insistent particularity of emotion that non-temporal generality which primarily belongs to conceptual thought alone . '' 
in other words , religion takes deeply felt emotions and contextualizes them within a system of general truths about the world , helping people to identify their wider meaning and significance . 
for whitehead , religion served as a kind of bridge between philosophy and the emotions and purposes of a particular society . 
it is the task of religion to make philosophy applicable to the everyday lives of ordinary people . 
margaret stout and carrie m. staton have also written recently on the mutual influence of whitehead and mary parker follett , a pioneer in the fields of organizational theory and organizational behavior . 
stout and staton see both whitehead and follett as sharing an ontology that `` understands becoming as a relational process ; difference as being related , yet unique ; and the purpose of becoming as harmonizing difference . '' 
this connection is further analyzed by stout and jeannine m. love in integrative process : follettian thinking from ontology to administration 
many asset managers chose to continue to invest client funds in over-priced -lrb- under-yielding -rrb- investments , to the detriment of their clients , in order to maintain their assets under management . 
moreover , a conflict of interest between professional investment managers and their institutional clients , combined with a global glut in investment capital , led to bad investments by asset managers in over-priced credit assets . 
professional investment managers generally are compensated based on the volume of client assets under management . 
there is , therefore , an incentive for asset managers to expand their assets under management in order to maximize their compensation . 
this choice was supported by a `` plausible deniability '' of the risks associated with subprime-based credit assets because the loss experience with early `` vintages '' of subprime loans was so low . 
the first visible institution to run into trouble in the united states was the southern california -- based indymac , a spin-off of countrywide financial . 
the failure of indymac bank on july 11 , 2008 , was the fourth largest bank failure in united states history up until the crisis precipitated even larger failures , and the second largest failure of a regulated thrift . 
the first visible institution to run into trouble in the united states was the southern california -- based indymac , a spin-off of countrywide financial . 
before its failure , indymac bank was the largest savings and loan association in the los angeles market and the seventh largest mortgage originator in the united states . 
indymac bank 's parent corporation was indymac bancorp until the fdic seized indymac bank . 
indymac reported that during april 2008 , moody 's and standard & poor 's downgraded the ratings on a significant number of mortgage-backed security -lrb- mbs -rrb- bonds including $ 160 million of those issued by indymac and which the bank retained in its mbs portfolio . 
had these lowered ratings been in effect at march 31 , 2008 , indymac concluded that the bank 's capital ratio would have been 9.27 % total risk-based .

indymac warned that if its regulators found its capital position to have fallen below `` well capitalized '' -lrb- minimum 10 % risk-based capital ratio -rrb- to `` adequately capitalized '' -lrb- 8 -- 10 % risk-based capital ratio -rrb- the bank might no longer be able to use brokered deposits as a source of funds . 
senator charles schumer -lrb- d-ny -rrb- would later point out that brokered deposits made up more than 37 percent of indymac 's total deposits and ask the federal deposit insurance corporation -lrb- fdic -rrb- whether it had considered ordering indymac to reduce its reliance on these deposits .

with $ 18.9 billion in total deposits reported on march 31 , senator schumer would have been referring to a little over $ 7 billion in brokered deposits . 
while the breakout of maturities of these deposits is not known exactly , a simple averaging would have put the threat of brokered deposits loss to indymac at $ 500 million a month , had the regulator disallowed indymac from acquiring new brokered deposits on june 30 .

its reduced liquidity was further exacerbated in late june 2008 when account holders withdrew $ 1.55 billion or about 7.5 % of indymac 's deposits . 
when home prices declined in the latter half of 2007 and the secondary mortgage market collapsed , indymac was forced to hold $ 10.7 billion of loans it could not sell in the secondary market . 
this `` run '' on the thrift followed the public release of a letter from senator charles schumer to the fdic and ots . 
while the run was a contributing factor in the timing of indymac 's demise , the underlying cause of the failure was the unsafe and unsound manner in which the thrift was operated . 
a bridge bank , indymac federal bank , fsb , was established to assume control of indymac bank 's assets , its secured liabilities , and its insured deposit accounts . 
the fdic guarantees the funds of all insured accounts up to us$ 100,000 , and has declared a special advance dividend to the roughly 10,000 depositors with funds in excess of the insured amount , guaranteeing 50 % of any amounts in excess of $ 100,000 .

economist paul krugman and u.s. treasury secretary timothy geithner explain the credit crisis via the implosion of the shadow banking system , which had grown to nearly equal the importance of the traditional commercial banking sector as described above . 
this meant that nearly one-third of the u.s. lending mechanism was frozen and continued to be frozen into june 2009 . 
while traditional banks have raised their lending standards , it was the collapse of the shadow banking system that is the primary cause of the reduction in funds available for borrowing . 
according to the brookings institution , the traditional banking system does not have the capital to close this gap as of june 2009 : `` it would take a number of years of strong profits to generate sufficient capital to support that additional lending volume '' . 
the authors also indicate that some forms of securitization are `` likely to vanish forever , having been an artifact of excessively loose credit conditions '' .

the continuing development of the crisis has prompted fears of a global economic collapse although there are now many cautiously optimistic forecasters in addition to some prominent sources who remain negative . 
investment bank ubs stated on october 6 that 2008 would see a clear global recession , with recovery unlikely for at least two years . 
ubs quantified their expected recession durations on october 16 : the eurozone 's would last two quarters , the united states ' would last three quarters , and the united kingdom 's would last four quarters . 
relative to the size of its economy , iceland 's banking collapse is the largest suffered by any country in economic history . 
three days later ubs economists announced that the `` beginning of the end '' of the crisis had begun , with the world starting to make the necessary actions to fix the crisis : capital injection by governments ; injection made systemically ; interest rate cuts to help borrowers . 
the brookings institution reported in june 2009 that u.s. consumption accounted for more than a third of the growth in global consumption between 2000 and 2007 . 
for the first quarter of 2009 , the annualized rate of decline in gdp was 14.4 % in germany , 15.2 % in japan , 7.4 % in the uk , 18 % in latvia , 9.8 % in the euro area and 21.5 % for mexico .

`` the us economy has been spending too much and borrowing too much for years and the rest of the world depended on the u.s. consumer as a source of global demand . '' 
with a recession in the u.s. and the increased savings rate of u.s. consumers , declines in growth elsewhere have been dramatic . 
for example , growth forecasts in cambodia show a fall from more than 10 % in 2007 to close to zero in 2009 , and kenya may achieve only 3 -- 4 % growth in 2009 , down from 7 % in 2007 .

those securities first in line received investment-grade ratings from rating agencies . 
this essentially places cash payments from multiple mortgages or other debt obligations into a single pool from which specific securities draw in a specific sequence of priority . 
securities with lower priority had lower credit ratings but theoretically a higher rate of return on the amount invested . 
by september 2008 , average u.s. housing prices had declined by over 20 % from their mid-2006 peak . 
by september 2008 , average u.s. housing prices had declined by over 20 % from their mid-2006 peak . 
during 2007 , lenders began foreclosure proceedings on nearly 1.3 million properties , a 79 % increase over 2006 . 
this increased to 2.3 million in 2008 , an 81 % increase vs. 2007 . 
by september 2009 , this had risen to 14.4 % . 
from 2000 to 2003 , the federal reserve lowered the federal funds rate target from 6.5 % to 1.0 % . 
this was done to soften the effects of the collapse of the dot-com bubble and the september 2001 terrorist attacks , as well as to combat a perceived risk of deflation . 
as early as 2002 it was apparent that credit was fueling housing instead of business investment as some economists went so far as to advocate that the fed `` needs to create a housing bubble to replace the nasdaq bubble '' . 
moreover , empirical studies using data from advanced countries show that excessive credit growth contributed greatly to the severity of the crisis . 
lower interest rates encouraged borrowing . 
bernanke explained that between 1996 and 2004 , the u.s. current account deficit increased by $ 650 billion , from 1.5 % to 5.8 % of gdp . 
bernanke explained that between 1996 and 2004 , the u.s. current account deficit increased by $ 650 billion , from 1.5 % to 5.8 % of gdp . 
these were mainly the emerging economies in asia and oil-exporting nations . 
the balance of payments identity requires that a country -lrb- such as the u.s. -rrb- running a current account deficit also have a capital account -lrb- investment -rrb- surplus of the same amount . 
hence large and growing amounts of foreign funds -lrb- capital -rrb- flowed into the u.s. to finance its imports . 
the fed then raised the fed funds rate significantly between july 2004 and july 2006 . 
this contributed to an increase in 1-year and 5-year adjustable-rate mortgage -lrb- arm -rrb- rates , making arm interest rate resets more expensive for homeowners . 
this may have also contributed to the deflating of the housing bubble , as asset prices generally move inversely to interest rates , and it became riskier to speculate in housing . 
the fed then raised the fed funds rate significantly between july 2004 and july 2006 . 
u.s. housing and financial assets dramatically declined in value after the housing bubble burst .

predatory lending refers to the practice of unscrupulous lenders , enticing borrowers to enter into `` unsafe '' or `` unsound '' secured loans for inappropriate purposes . 
a classic bait-and-switch method was used by countrywide financial , advertising low interest rates for home refinancing . 
whereas the advertisement might state that 1 % or 1.5 % interest would be charged , the consumer would be put into an adjustable rate mortgage -lrb- arm -rrb- in which the interest charged would be greater than the amount of interest paid . 
this created negative amortization , which the credit consumer might not notice until long after the loan transaction had been consummated .

a recent oecd study suggest that bank regulation based on the basel accords encourage unconventional business practices and contributed to or even reinforced the financial crisis . 
prior to the crisis , financial institutions became highly leveraged , increasing their appetite for risky investments and reducing their resilience in case of losses . 
much of this leverage was achieved using complex financial instruments such as off-balance sheet securitization and derivatives , which made it difficult for creditors and regulators to monitor and try to reduce financial institution risk levels . 
these instruments also made it virtually impossible to reorganize financial institutions in bankruptcy , and contributed to the need for government bailouts .

these five institutions reported over $ 4.1 trillion in debt for fiscal year 2007 , about 30 % of usa nominal gdp for 2007 . 
lehman brothers went bankrupt and was liquidated , bear stearns and merrill lynch were sold at fire-sale prices , and goldman sachs and morgan stanley became commercial banks , subjecting themselves to more stringent regulation . 
behavior that may be optimal for an individual -lrb- e.g. , saving more during adverse economic conditions -rrb- can be detrimental if too many individuals pursue the same behavior , as ultimately one person 's consumption is another person 's income .

the term financial innovation refers to the ongoing development of financial products designed to achieve particular client objectives , such as offsetting a particular risk exposure -lrb- such as the default of a borrower -rrb- or to assist with obtaining financing . 
examples pertinent to this crisis included : the adjustable-rate mortgage ; the bundling of subprime mortgages into mortgage-backed securities -lrb- mbs -rrb- or collateralized debt obligations -lrb- cdo -rrb- for sale to investors , a type of securitization ; and a form of credit insurance called credit default swaps -lrb- cds -rrb- .

it multiplied the number of actors connected to a single mortgage -lrb- including mortgage brokers , specialized originators , the securitizers and their due diligence firms , managing agents and trading desks , and finally investors , insurances and providers of repo funding -rrb- . 
with increasing distance from the underlying asset these actors relied more and more on indirect information -lrb- including fico scores on creditworthiness , appraisals and due diligence checks by third party organizations , and most importantly the computer models of rating agencies and risk management desks -rrb- .

several scholars have argued that a lack of transparency about banks ' risk exposures prevented markets from correctly pricing risk before the crisis , enabled the mortgage market to grow larger than it otherwise would have , and made the financial crisis far more disruptive than it would have been if risk levels had been disclosed in a straightforward , readily understandable format .

the basic cds transaction involved aig receiving a premium in exchange for a promise to pay money to party a in the event party b defaulted . 
george soros commented that `` the super-boom got out of hand when the new products became so complicated that the authorities could no longer calculate the risks and started relying on the risk management methods of the banks themselves . 
as financial assets became more and more complex , and harder and harder to value , investors were reassured by the fact that both the international bond rating agencies and bank regulators , who came to rely on them , accepted as valid some complex mathematical models which theoretically showed the risks were much smaller than they actually proved to be .

an increase in oil prices tends to divert a larger share of consumer spending into gasoline , which creates downward pressure on economic growth in oil importing countries , as wealth flows to oil-producing states .

market strategist phil dow believes distinctions exist `` between the current market malaise '' and the great depression . 
he says the dow jones average 's fall of more than 50 % over a period of 17 months is similar to a 54.7 % fall in the great depression , followed by a total drop of 89 % over the following 16 months .

floyd norris , the chief financial correspondent of the new york times , wrote in a blog entry in march 2009 that the decline has not been a mirror image of the great depression , explaining that although the decline amounts were nearly the same at the time , the rates of decline had started much faster in 2007 , and that the past year had only ranked eighth among the worst recorded years of percentage drops in the dow . 
one of the first victims was northern rock , a medium-sized british bank . 
the highly leveraged nature of its business led the bank to request security from the bank of england . 
this in turn led to investor panic and a bank run in mid-september 2007 . 
calls by liberal democrat treasury spokesman vince cable to nationalise the institution were initially ignored ; in february 2008 , however , the british government -lrb- having failed to find a private sector buyer -rrb- relented , and the bank was taken into public hands . 
northern rock 's problems proved to be an early indication of the troubles that would soon befall other banks and financial institutions . 
indymac often made loans without verification of the borrower 's income or assets , and to borrowers with poor credit histories . 
appraisals obtained by indymac on underlying collateral were often questionable as well . 
indymac often made loans without verification of the borrower 's income or assets , and to borrowers with poor credit histories . 
as an alt-a lender , indymac 's business model was to offer loan products to fit the borrower 's needs , using an extensive array of risky option-adjustable-rate-mortgages -lrb- option arms -rrb- , subprime loans , 80/20 loans , and other nontraditional products . 
indymac resisted efforts to regulate its involvement in those loans or tighten their issuing criteria : see the comment by ruthann melbourne , chief risk officer , to the regulating agencies . 
on the other hand , half of the poorest families did not have wealth declines at all during the crisis . 
the federal reserve surveyed 4,000 households between 2007 and 2009 , and found that the total wealth of 63 percent of all americans declined in that period . 
77 percent of the richest families had a decrease in total wealth , while only 50 percent of those on the bottom of the pyramid suffered a decrease .

on the same day , the bank of england and the european central bank , respectively , reduced their interest rates from 4.5 % down to 3 % , and from 3.75 % down to 3.25 % . 
the u.s. federal reserve and central banks around the world have taken steps to expand money supplies to avoid the risk of a deflationary spiral , in which lower wages and higher unemployment lead to a self-reinforcing decline in global consumption . 
in addition , governments have enacted large fiscal stimulus packages , by borrowing and spending to offset the reduction in private sector demand caused by the crisis . 
the u.s. federal reserve 's new and expanded liquidity facilities were intended to enable the central bank to fulfill its traditional lender-of-last-resort role during the crisis while mitigating stigma , broadening the set of institutions with access to liquidity , and increasing the flexibility with which institutions could tap such liquidity .

this credit freeze brought the global financial system to the brink of collapse . 
during the last quarter of 2008 , these central banks purchased us$ 2.5 trillion of government debt and troubled private assets from banks . 
following a model initiated by the united kingdom bank rescue package , the governments of european nations and the usa guaranteed the debt issued by their banks and raised the capital of their national banking systems , ultimately purchasing $ 1.5 trillion newly issued preferred stock in their major banks . 
in october 2010 , nobel laureate joseph stiglitz explained how the u.s. federal reserve was implementing another monetary policy -- creating currency -- as a method to combat the liquidity trap . 
however , banks instead were spending the money in more profitable areas by investing internationally in emerging markets . 
united states president barack obama and key advisers introduced a series of regulatory proposals in june 2009 . 
the proposals address consumer protection , executive pay , bank financial cushions or capital requirements , expanded regulation of the shadow banking system and derivatives , and enhanced authority for the federal reserve to safely wind-down systemically important institutions , among others . 
in january 2010 , obama proposed additional regulations limiting the ability of banks to engage in proprietary trading . 
the proposals were dubbed `` the volcker rule '' , in recognition of paul volcker , who has publicly argued for the proposed changes .

the crisis played a significant role in the failure of key businesses , declines in consumer wealth estimated in trillions of u.s. dollars , and a downturn in economic activity leading to the 2008 -- 2012 global recession and contributing to the european sovereign-debt crisis . 
the active phase of the crisis , which manifested as a liquidity crisis , can be dated from august 9 , 2007 , when bnp paribas terminated withdrawals from three hedge funds citing `` a complete evaporation of liquidity '' .

the bursting of the u.s. -lrb- united states -rrb- housing bubble , which peaked in 2004 , caused the values of securities tied to u.s. real estate pricing to plummet , damaging financial institutions globally . 
in the u.s. , congress passed the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 . 
the financial crisis was triggered by a complex interplay of policies that encouraged home ownership , providing easier access to loans for subprime borrowers , overvaluation of bundled subprime mortgages based on the theory that housing prices would continue to escalate , questionable trading practices on behalf of both buyers and sellers , compensation structures that prioritize short-term deal flow over long-term value creation , and a lack of adequate capital holdings from banks and insurance companies to back the financial commitments they were making .

the u.s. senate 's levin -- coburn report concluded that the crisis was the result of `` high risk , complex financial products ; undisclosed conflicts of interest ; the failure of regulators , the credit rating agencies , and the market itself to rein in the excesses of wall street . '' 
the 1999 repeal of the glass-steagall act effectively removed the separation between investment banks and depository banks in the united states . 
the financial crisis inquiry commission concluded that the financial crisis was avoidable and was caused by `` widespread failures in financial regulation and supervision '' , `` dramatic failures of corporate governance and risk management at many systemically important financial institutions '' , `` a combination of excessive borrowing , risky investments , and lack of transparency '' by financial institutions , ill preparation and inconsistent action by government that `` added to the uncertainty and panic '' , a `` systemic breakdown in accountability and ethics '' , `` collapsing mortgage-lending standards and the mortgage securitization pipeline '' , deregulation of over-the-counter derivatives , especially credit default swaps , and `` the failures of credit rating agencies '' to correctly price risk . 
critics argued that credit rating agencies and investors failed to accurately price the risk involved with mortgage-related financial products , and that governments did not adjust their regulatory practices to address 21st-century financial markets .

total losses are estimated in the trillions of u.s. dollars globally . 
falling prices also resulted in homes worth less than the mortgage loan , providing a financial incentive to enter foreclosure . 
the ongoing foreclosure epidemic that began in late 2006 in the u.s. continues to drain wealth from consumers and erodes the financial strength of banking institutions . 
defaults and losses on other loan types also increased significantly as the crisis expanded from the housing market to other parts of the economy .

while the housing and credit bubbles were building , a series of factors caused the financial system to both expand and become increasingly fragile , a process called financialization . 
u.s. government policy from the 1970s onward has emphasized deregulation to encourage business , which resulted in less oversight of activities and less disclosure of information about new activities undertaken by banks and other evolving financial institutions .

these institutions , as well as certain regulated banks , had also assumed significant debt burdens while providing the loans described above and did not have a financial cushion sufficient to absorb large loan defaults or mbs losses . 
these losses impacted the ability of financial institutions to lend , slowing economic activity . 
concerns regarding the stability of key financial institutions drove central banks to provide funds to encourage lending and restore faith in the commercial paper markets , which are integral to funding business operations . 
governments also bailed out key financial institutions and implemented economic stimulus programs , assuming significant additional financial commitments .

the u.s. financial crisis inquiry commission reported its findings in january 2011 . 
it concluded that `` the crisis was avoidable and was caused by : widespread failures in financial regulation , including the federal reserve 's failure to stem the tide of toxic mortgages ; dramatic breakdowns in corporate governance including too many financial firms acting recklessly and taking on too much risk ; an explosive mix of excessive borrowing and risk by households and wall street that put the financial system on a collision course with crisis ; key policy makers ill prepared for the crisis , lacking a full understanding of the financial system they oversaw ; and systemic breaches in accountability and ethics at all levels '' .

during a period of tough competition between mortgage lenders for revenue and market share , and when the supply of creditworthy borrowers was limited , mortgage lenders relaxed underwriting standards and originated riskier mortgages to less creditworthy borrowers . 
in the view of some analysts , the relatively conservative government-sponsored enterprises -lrb- gses -rrb- policed mortgage originators and maintained relatively high underwriting standards prior to 2003 . 
the worst loans were originated in 2004 -- 2007 , the years of the most intense competition between securitizers and the lowest market share for the gses .

critics also point out that publicly announced cra loan commitments were massive , totaling $ 4.5 trillion in the years between 1994 and 2007 .

in classical genetics , in a sexually reproducing organism -lrb- typically eukarya -rrb- the gamete has half the number of chromosomes of the somatic cell and the genome is a full set of chromosomes in a diploid cell . 
the halving of the genetic material in gametes is accomplished by the segregation of homologous chromosomes during meiosis .

genome composition is used to describe the make up of contents of a haploid genome , which should include genome size , proportions of non-repetitive dna and repetitive dna in details . 
by comparing the genome compositions between genomes , scientists can better understand the evolutionary history of a given genome . 
when talking about genome composition , one should distinguish between prokaryotes and eukaryotes as the big differences on contents structure they have . 
on the contrary , eukaryotes have the feature of exon-intron organization of protein coding genes ; the variation of repetitive dna content in eukaryotes is also extremely high . 
in mammals and plants , the major part of the genome is composed of repetitive dna . 
in some contexts , such as sequencing the genome of a pathogenic microbe , `` genome '' is meant to include information stored on this auxiliary material , which is carried in plasmids . 
most biological entities that are more complex than a virus sometimes or always carry additional genetic material besides that which resides in their chromosomes . 
in some contexts , such as sequencing the genome of a pathogenic microbe , `` genome '' is meant to include information stored on this auxiliary material , which is carried in plasmids . 
in eukaryotes such as plants , protozoa and animals , however , `` genome '' carries the typical connotation of only information on chromosomal dna . 
the dna found within the chloroplast may be referred to as the `` plastome '' . 
in fact , mitochondria are sometimes said to have their own genome often referred to as the `` mitochondrial genome '' . 
genome size is the total number of dna base pairs in one copy of a haploid genome . 
the genome size is positively correlated with the morphological complexity among prokaryotes and lower eukaryotes ; however , after mollusks and all the other higher eukaryotes above , this correlation is no longer effective . 
this phenomenon also indicates the mighty influence coming from repetitive dna act on the genomes . 
there is experimental work being done on minimal genomes for single cell organisms as well as minimal genomes for multi-cellular organisms -lrb- see developmental biology -rrb- . 
the work is both in vivo and in silico . 
protein-coding genes and rna-coding genes are generally non-repetitive dna . 
the proportion of non-repetitive dna is calculated by using the length of non-repetitive dna divided by genome size . 
the proportion of non-repetitive dna is calculated by using the length of non-repetitive dna divided by genome size . 
some e. coli as prokaryotes only have non-repetitive dna , lower eukaryotes such as c. elegans and fruit fly , still possess more non-repetitive dna than repetitive dna . 
some e. coli as prokaryotes only have non-repetitive dna , lower eukaryotes such as c. elegans and fruit fly , still possess more non-repetitive dna than repetitive dna . 
in some plants and amphibians , the proportion of non-repetitive dna is no more than 20 % , becoming a minority component . 
there are two categories of repetitive dna in genome : tandem repeats and interspersed repeats . 
the proportion of repetitive dna is calculated by using length of repetitive dna divide by genome size . 
tandem repeats are usually caused by slippage during replication , unequal crossing-over and gene conversion , satellite dna and microsatellites are forms of tandem repeats in the genome . 
tandem repeats are usually caused by slippage during replication , unequal crossing-over and gene conversion , satellite dna and microsatellites are forms of tandem repeats in the genome . 
although tandem repeats count for a significant proportion in genome , the largest proportion in mammalian is the other type , interspersed repeats . 
transposable elements are able to integrate into the genome at another site within the cell . 
it is believed that tes are an important driving force on genome evolution of higher eukaryotes . 
tes can be classified into two categories , class 1 -lrb- retrotransposons -rrb- and class 2 -lrb- dna transposons -rrb- . 
tes can be classified into two categories , class 1 -lrb- retrotransposons -rrb- and class 2 -lrb- dna transposons -rrb- . 
retrotransposons can be transcribed into rna , which are then duplicated at another site into the genome . 
dna transposons generally move by `` cut and paste '' in the genome , but duplication has also been observed . 
class 2 tes do not use rna as intermediate and are popular in bacteria , in metazoan it has also been found . 
researchers compare traits such as chromosome number -lrb- karyotype -rrb- , genome size , gene order , codon usage bias , and gc-content to determine what mechanisms could have produced the great variety of genomes that exist today -lrb- for recent overviews , see brown 2002 ; saccone and pesole 2003 ; benfey and protopapas 2004 ; gibson and muse 2004 ; reese 2004 ; gregory 2005 -rrb- .

duplications play a major role in shaping the genome . 
such duplications are probably fundamental to the creation of genetic novelty . 
horizontal gene transfer is invoked to explain how there is often extreme similarity between small portions of the genomes of two organisms that are otherwise very distantly related . 
horizontal gene transfer seems to be common among many microbes . 
also , eukaryotic cells seem to have experienced a transfer of some genetic material from their chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes to their nuclear chromosomes . 
a comprehensive school is a state school that does not select its intake on the basis of academic achievement or aptitude . 
this is in contrast to the selective school system , where admission is restricted on the basis of selection criteria . 
the term is commonly used in relation to england and wales , where comprehensive schools were introduced on an experimental basis in the 1940s and became more widespread from 1965 . 
about 90 % of british secondary school pupils now attend comprehensive schools . 
they correspond broadly to the public high school in the united states and canada and to the german gesamtschule . 
a consequence of that is a wider ranging curriculum , including practical subjects such as design and technology and vocational learning , which were less common or non-existent in grammar schools . 
this is why schools have tended to get larger and also why many local authorities have organised secondary education into 11 -- 16 schools , with the post-16 provision provided by sixth form colleges and further education colleges . 
in addition , government initiatives such as the city technology colleges and specialist schools programmes have made the comprehensive ideal less certain . 
although comprehensive schools were introduced to england and wales in 1965 , there are 164 selective grammar schools that are still in operation . 
although comprehensive schools were introduced to england and wales in 1965 , there are 164 selective grammar schools that are still in operation . 
in principle , comprehensive schools were conceived as `` neighbourhood '' schools for all students in a specified catchment area . 
current education reforms with academies programme , free schools and university technical colleges will no doubt have some impact on the comprehensive ideal but it is too early to say to what degree .

germany has a comprehensive school known as the gesamtschule . 
they offer college preparatory classes for the students who are doing well , general education classes for average students , and remedial courses for those who are n't doing that well . 
in most cases students attending a gesamtschule may graduate with the hauptschulabschluss , the realschulabschluss or the abitur depending on how well they did in school . 
in the state of brandenburg more than 50 % of all students attended a gesamtschule in 2007 , while in the state of bavaria less than 1 % did .

the `` mittelschule '' is a school in some states of germany that offers regular classes and remedial classes but no college preparatory classes . 
students may be awarded the hauptschulabschluss or the mittlere reife but not the abitur . 
in some states of germany , the hauptschule does not exist , and any student who has not been accepted by another school has to attend the mittelschule . 
comprehensive schools have been accused of grade inflation after a study revealed that gymnasium senior students of average mathematical ability found themselves at the very bottom of their class and had an average grade of `` five '' , which means `` failed '' .

gesamtschulen might put bright working class students at risk according to several studies . 
it could be shown that an achievement gap opens between working class students attending a comprehensive and their middle class peers . 
however it is not students attending a comprehensive , but students attending a hauptschule , who perform the poorest . 
according to a study done by helmut fend -lrb- who had always been a fierce proponent of comprehensive schools -rrb- revealed that comprehensive schools do not help working class students . 
he compared alumni of the tripartite system to alumni of comprehensive schools .

comprehensive schools were introduced into ireland in 1966 by an initiative by patrick hillery , minister for education , to give a broader range of education compared to that of the vocational school system , which was then the only system of schools completely controlled by the state . 
the comprehensive school system is still relatively small and to an extent has been superseded by the community school concept . 
in ireland comprehensive schools were an earlier model of state schools , introduced in the late 1960s and largely replaced by the secular community model of the 1970s . 
the state owns the school property , which is vested in the trustees in perpetuity . 
the introduction of the community school model in the 1970s controversially removed the denominational basis of the schools , but religious interests were invited to be represented on the boards of management . 
community colleges tended to be amalgamations of unviable local schools under the umbrella of a new community school model , but community schools have tended to be entirely new foundations .

in 2010 , another technical university named bursa technical university was founded in bursa . 
moreover , a sixth technical university is about to be opened in konya named konya technical university . 
in 1950s , 2 technical universities were opened in ankara and trabzon . 
since 1970 uk polytechnics operated under the binary system of education along with universities . 
polytechnics offered diplomas and degrees -lrb- bachelor 's , master 's , phd -rrb- validated at the national level by the uk council for national academic awards cnaa . 
the comparable institutions in scotland were collectively referred to as central institutions . 
britain 's first polytechnic , the royal polytechnic institution later known as the polytechnic of central london -lrb- now the university of westminster -rrb- was established in 1838 at regent street in london and its goal was to educate and popularize engineering and scientific knowledge and inventions in victorian britain `` at little expense . '' 
the designation `` institute of technology '' was occasionally used by polytechnics -lrb- bolton -rrb- , central institutions -lrb- dundee , robert gordon 's -rrb- , and postgraduate universities , -lrb- cranfield and wessex -rrb- , most of which later adopted the designation university , and there were two `` institutes of science and technology '' : umist and uwist , part of the university of wales . 
loughborough university was called loughborough university of technology from 1966 to 1996 , the only institution in the uk to have had such a designation . 
they became universities in the 1960s meaning they could award their own degrees . 
polytechnics were granted university status under the further and higher education act 1992 . 
this meant that polytechnics could confer degrees without the oversight of the national cnaa organization . 
most technical institutes have been merged into regional colleges and some have been designated university colleges if they are associated with a local university . 
schools called `` technical institute '' or `` technical school '' that were formed in the early 20th century provided further education between high school and university or polytechnic .

the earliest and most famous of these institutions are , respectively , rensselaer polytechnic institute -lrb- rpi , 1824 -rrb- , new york university tandon school of engineering -lrb- 1854 -rrb- and the massachusetts institute of technology -lrb- mit , 1861 -rrb- .

at that time , technical education was considered essential for the development of a sound middle class economy . 
institutes of technology in venezuela were developed in the 1950s as an option for post-secondary education in technical and scientific courses , after the polytechnic french concepts . 
the institute of technology implementation -lrb- iut from instituto universitario de tecnologia on spanish -rrb- began with the creation of the first iut at caracas , capital city of venezuela , called iut . 
dr. federico rivero palacio adopted the french `` institut universitaire de technologie `` s system , using french personnel and study system based on three-year periods , with research and engineering facilities at the same level as the main national universities to obtain french equivalent degrees .

it was set up by brewster kahle and bruce gilliat , and is maintained with content from alexa internet . 
the service enables users to see archived versions of web pages across time , which the archive calls a `` three dimensional index . '' 
since 1996 , they have been archiving cached pages of web sites onto their large cluster of linux nodes . 
they revisit sites every few weeks or months and archive a new version if the content has changed . 
their grand vision is to archive the entire internet . 
the name wayback machine was chosen as a droll reference to a plot device in an animated cartoon series , the rocky and bullwinkle show . 
in one of the animated cartoon 's component segments , peabody 's improbable history , lead characters mr. peabody and sherman routinely used a time machine called the `` wabac machine '' -lrb- pronounced way-back -rrb- to witness , participate in , and , more often than not , alter famous events in history .

in 1996 brewster kahle , with bruce gilliat , developed software to crawl and download all publicly accessible world wide web pages , the gopher hierarchy , the netnews -lrb- usenet -rrb- bulletin board system , and downloadable software . 
the information collected by these `` crawlers '' does not include all the information available on the internet , since much of the data is restricted by the publisher or stored in databases that are not accessible . 
these `` crawlers '' also respect the robots exclusion standard for websites whose owners opt for them not to appear in search results or be cached . 
to overcome inconsistencies in partially cached web sites , archive-it . 
information had been kept on digital tape for five years , with kahle occasionally allowing researchers and scientists to tap into the clunky database .

netbula objected to the motion on the ground that defendants were asking to alter netbula 's web site and that they should have subpoenaed internet archive for the pages directly . 
an employee of internet archive filed a sworn statement supporting chordiant 's motion , however , stating that it could not produce the web pages by any other means `` without considerable burden , expense and disruption to its operations . '' 
magistrate judge howard lloyd in the northern district of california , san jose division , rejected netbula 's arguments and ordered them to disable the robots.txt blockage temporarily in order to allow chordiant to retrieve the archived pages that they sought .

telewizja polska brought a motion in limine to suppress the snapshots on the grounds of hearsay and unauthenticated source , but magistrate judge arlander keys rejected telewizja polska 's assertion of hearsay and denied tvp 's motion in limine to exclude the evidence at trial . 
at the trial , however , district court judge ronald guzman , the trial judge , overruled magistrate keys ' findings , -lsb- citation needed -rsb- and held that neither the affidavit of the internet archive employee nor the underlying pages -lrb- i.e. , the telewizja polska website -rrb- were admissible as evidence . 
these dates are used to determine if a web page is available as prior art for instance in examining a patent application . 
provided some additional requirements are met -lrb- e.g. providing an authoritative statement of the archivist -rrb- , the united states patent office and the european patent office will accept date stamps from the internet archive as evidence of when a given web page was accessible to the public . 
there are technical limitations to archiving a web site , and as a consequence , it is possible for opposing parties in litigation to misuse the results provided by web site archives . 
this problem can be exacerbated by the practice of submitting screen shots of web pages in complaints , answers , or expert witness reports , when the underlying links are not exposed and therefore , can contain errors . 
for example , archives such as the wayback machine do not fill out forms and therefore , do not include the contents of non-restful e-commerce databases in their archives .

alternative names include the united provinces -lrb- verenigde provinciën -rrb- , federated dutch provinces -lrb- foederatae belgii provinciae -rrb- , and dutch federation -lrb- belgica foederata -rrb- . 
the dutch republic , also known as the republic of the seven united netherlands -lrb- republiek der zeven verenigde nederlanden -rrb- , republic of the united netherlands or republic of the seven united provinces -lrb- republiek der zeven verenigde provinciën -rrb- , was a republic in europe existing from 1581 , when part of the netherlands separated from spanish rule , until 1795 . 
it preceded the batavian republic , the kingdom of holland , the united kingdom of the netherlands , and ultimately the modern kingdom of the netherlands . 
until the 16th century , the low countries -- corresponding roughly to the present-day netherlands , belgium , and luxembourg -- consisted of a number of duchies , counties , and prince-bishoprics , almost all of which were under the supremacy of the holy roman empire , with the exception of the county of flanders , which was under the kingdom of france .

most of the low countries had come under the rule of the house of burgundy and subsequently the house of habsburg . 
in 1549 holy roman emperor charles v issued the pragmatic sanction , which further unified the seventeen provinces under his rule .

this was unsuccessful and in 1588 the provinces became a confederacy . 
the republic of the united provinces lasted until a series of republican revolutions in 1783 -- 1795 created the batavian republic . 
the republican forces fled to france , but then successfully re-invaded alongside the army of the french republic .

the netherlands regained independence from france in 1813 . 
in the anglo-dutch treaty of 1814 the names `` united provinces of the netherlands '' and `` united netherlands '' were used . 
in 1815 it was rejoined with the austrian netherlands , luxembourg and liège -lrb- the `` southern provinces '' -rrb- to become the kingdom of the netherlands , informally known as the kingdom of the united netherlands , to create a strong buffer state north of france . 
during the dutch golden age in the late 16th century onward , the dutch republic dominated world trade in the 17th century , conquering a vast colonial empire and operating the largest fleet of merchantmen of any nation . 
the county of holland was the wealthiest and most urbanized region in the world . 
the netherlands has the oldest stock exchange in the world , founded in 1602 by the dutch east india company . 
while rotterdam has the oldest bourse in the netherlands , the world 's first stock exchange -- that of the dutch east-india company -- went public in six different cities . 
while rotterdam has the oldest bourse in the netherlands , the world 's first stock exchange -- that of the dutch east-india company -- went public in six different cities . 
later , a court ruled that the company had to reside legally in a single city , so amsterdam is recognized as the oldest such institution based on modern trading principles . 
between 1590 -- 1712 the dutch also possessed one of the strongest and fastest navies in the world , allowing for their varied conquests including breaking the portuguese sphere of influence on the indian ocean and in the orient , as well as a lucrative slave trade from africa and the pacific .

the republic was a confederation of seven provinces , which had their own governments and were very independent , and a number of so-called generality lands . 
the latter were governed directly by the states general -lrb- staten-generaal in dutch -rrb- , the federal government . 
the states general were seated in the hague and consisted of representatives of each of the seven provinces . 
in fact , there was an eighth province , the county of drenthe , but this area was so poor it was exempt from paying federal taxes and as a consequence was denied representation in the states general .

in times of war , the stadtholder , who commanded the army , would have more power than the raadspensionaris . 
in times of war , the stadtholder , who commanded the army , would have more power than the raadspensionaris . 
in theory , the stadtholders were freely appointed by and subordinate to the states of each province . 
however , in practice the princes of orange of the house of orange-nassau , beginning with william the silent , were always chosen as stadtholders of most of the provinces . 
zeeland and usually utrecht had the same stadtholder as holland . 
there was a constant power struggle between the orangists , who supported the stadtholders and specifically the princes of orange , and the republicans , who supported the states general and hoped to replace the semi-hereditary nature of the stadtholdership with a true republican structure .

after the peace of westphalia , several border territories were assigned to the united provinces . 
they were federally-governed generality lands -lrb- generaliteitslanden -rrb- . 
they were staats-brabant -lrb- present north brabant -rrb- , staats-vlaanderen -lrb- present zeeuws-vlaanderen -rrb- , staats-limburg -lrb- around maastricht -rrb- and staats-oppergelre -lrb- around venlo , after 1715 -rrb- . 
the states general of the united provinces were in control of the dutch east india company -lrb- voc -rrb- and the dutch west india company -lrb- wic -rrb- , but some shipping expeditions were initiated by some of the provinces , mostly holland and/or zeeland .

apart from this , the american declaration of independence is similar to the act of abjuration , essentially the declaration of independence of the united provinces , but concrete evidence that the former directly influenced the latter is absent . 
in the union of utrecht of 20 january 1579 , holland and zeeland were granted the right to accept only one religion -lrb- in practice , calvinism -rrb- . 
every other province had the freedom to regulate the religious question as it wished , although the union stated every person should be free in the choice of personal religion and that no person should be prosecuted based on religious choice . 
william of orange had been a strong supporter of public and personal freedom of religion and hoped to unite protestants and catholics in the new union , and , for him , the union was a defeat . 
in practice , catholic services in all provinces were quickly forbidden , and the reformed church became the `` public '' or `` privileged '' church in the republic . 
during the republic , any person who wished to hold public office had to conform to the reformed church and take an oath to this effect . 
the extent to which different religions or denominations were persecuted depended much on the time period and regional or city leaders . 
in 17th-century leiden , for instance , people opening their homes to services could be fined 200 guilders -lrb- a year 's wage for a skilled tradesman -rrb- and banned from the city . 
throughout this , however , personal freedom of religion existed and was one factor -- along with economic reasons -- in causing large immigration of religious refugees from other parts of europe . 
in the first years of the republic , controversy arose within the reformed church , mainly around the subject of predestination . 
this has become known as the struggle between arminianism and gomarism , or between remonstrants and contra-remonstrants . 
in 1618 the synod of dort tackled this issue , which led to the banning of the remonstrant faith . 
beginning in the 18th century , the situation changed from more or less active persecution of religious services to a state of restricted toleration of other religions , as long as their services took place secretly in private churches .

symbiosis -lrb- from greek σύν `` together '' and βίωσις `` living '' -rrb- is close and often long-term interaction between two different biological species . 
in 1877 albert bernhard frank used the word symbiosis -lrb- which previously had been used to depict people living together in community -rrb- to describe the mutualistic relationship in lichens . 
in 1879 , the german mycologist heinrich anton de bary defined it as `` the living together of unlike organisms . '' 
after 130 years of debate , current biology and ecology textbooks now use the latter `` de bary '' definition or an even broader definition -lrb- where symbiosis means all species interactions -rrb- , with the restrictive definition no longer used -lrb- in other words , symbiosis means mutualism -rrb- . 
some symbiotic relationships are obligate , meaning that both symbionts entirely depend on each other for survival . 
others are facultative -lrb- optional -rrb- : they can , but do not have to live with the other organism . 
for example , many lichens consist of fungal and photosynthetic symbionts that can not live on their own . 
symbiotic relationships include those associations in which one organism lives on another -lrb- ectosymbiosis , such as mistletoe -rrb- , or where one partner lives inside the other -lrb- endosymbiosis , such as lactobacilli and other bacteria in humans or symbiodinium in corals -rrb- . 
symbiosis is also classified by physical attachment of the organisms ; symbiosis in which the organisms have bodily union is called conjunctive symbiosis , and symbiosis in which they are not in union is called disjunctive symbiosis . 
symbiotic relationships include those associations in which one organism lives on another -lrb- ectosymbiosis , such as mistletoe -rrb- , or where one partner lives inside the other -lrb- endosymbiosis , such as lactobacilli and other bacteria in humans or symbiodinium in corals -rrb- . 
examples include diverse microbiomes , rhizobia , nitrogen-fixing bacteria that live in root nodules on legume roots ; actinomycete nitrogen-fixing bacteria called frankia , which live in alder tree root nodules ; single-celled algae inside reef-building corals ; and bacterial endosymbionts that provide essential nutrients to about 10 % -- 15 % of insects .

examples of this include ectoparasites such as lice , commensal ectosymbionts such as the barnacles that attach themselves to the jaw of baleen whales , and mutualist ectosymbionts such as cleaner fish .

ectosymbiosis , also referred to as exosymbiosis , is any symbiotic relationship in which the symbiont lives on the body surface of the host , including the inner surface of the digestive tract or the ducts of exocrine glands . 
mutualism or interspecies reciprocal altruism is a relationship between individuals of different species where both individuals benefit . 
in general , only lifelong interactions involving close physical and biochemical contact can properly be considered symbiotic . 
a large percentage of herbivores have mutualistic gut flora that help them digest plant matter , which is more difficult to digest than animal prey . 
coral reefs are the result of mutualisms between coral organisms and various types of algae that live inside them . 
most land plants and land ecosystems rely on mutualisms between the plants , which fix carbon from the air , and mycorrhyzal fungi , which help in extracting water and minerals from the ground .

an example of mutual symbiosis is the relationship between the ocellaris clownfish that dwell among the tentacles of ritteri sea anemones . 
a special mucus on the clownfish protects it from the stinging tentacles .

a further example is the goby fish , which sometimes lives together with a shrimp . 
in case of danger the goby fish touches the shrimp with its tail to warn it . 
another non-obligate symbiosis is known from encrusting bryozoans and hermit crabs that live in a close relationship . 
these worms were discovered in the late 1980s at the hydrothermal vents near the galapagos islands and have since been found at deep-sea hydrothermal vents and cold seeps in all of the world 's oceans . 
the worm has no digestive tract and is wholly reliant on its internal symbionts for nutrition . 
these worms were discovered in the late 1980s at the hydrothermal vents near the galapagos islands and have since been found at deep-sea hydrothermal vents and cold seeps in all of the world 's oceans . 
during mutualistic symbioses , the host cell lacks some of the nutrients , which are provided by the endosymbiont . 
as a result , the host favors endosymbiont 's growth processes within itself by producing some specialized cells . 
these cells affect the genetic composition of the host in order to regulate the increasing population of the endosymbionts and ensuring that these genetic changes are passed onto the offspring via vertical transmission -lrb- heredity -rrb- . 
adaptation of the endosymbiont to the host 's lifestyle leads to many changes in the endosymbiont -- the foremost being drastic reduction in its genome size . 
this incapability of the endosymbiotic bacteria to reinstate its wild type phenotype via a recombination process is called as muller 's ratchet phenomenon . 
this could have been due to lack of selection mechanisms prevailing in the rich environment of the host . 
the word derives from the medieval latin word , formed from com - and mensa , meaning `` sharing a table '' . 
commensalism describes a relationship between two living organisms where one benefits and the other is not significantly harmed or helped . 
commensal relationships may involve one organism using another for transportation -lrb- phoresy -rrb- or for housing -lrb- inquilinism -rrb- , or it may also involve one organism using something another created , after its death -lrb- metabiosis -rrb- .

a parasitic relationship is one in which one member of the association benefits while the other is harmed . 
in addition , parasites may be necrotrophic , which is to say they kill their host , or biotrophic , meaning they rely on their host 's surviving . 
in addition , parasites may be necrotrophic , which is to say they kill their host , or biotrophic , meaning they rely on their host 's surviving . 
depending on the definition used , as many as half of all animals have at least one parasitic phase in their life cycles , and it is also frequent in plants and fungi . 
an example of a biotrophic relationship would be a tick feeding on the blood of its host . 
amensalism is the type of relationship that exists where one species is inhibited or completely obliterated and one is unaffected . 
-lsb- citation needed -rsb- there are two types of amensalism , competition and antibiosis .

-lsb- citation needed -rsb- an example of antibiosis is juglans nigra -lrb- black walnut -rrb- , secreting juglone , a substance which destroys many herbaceous plants within its root zone . 
amensalism is often used to describe strongly asymmetrical competitive interactions , such as has been observed between the spanish ibex and weevils of the genus timarcha which feed upon the same type of shrub .

amensalism is an interaction where an organism inflicts harm to another organism without any costs or benefits received by the other . 
synnecrosis is a rare type of symbiosis in which the interaction between species is detrimental to both organisms involved . 
it is a short-lived condition , as the interaction eventually causes death . 
because of this , evolution selects against synnecrosis and it is uncommon in nature . 
species of bees who die after stinging their prey inflict pain on themselves -lrb- albeit to protect the hive -rrb- as well as on the victim . 
in fact , the evolution of all eukaryotes -lrb- plants , animals , fungi , and protists -rrb- is believed under the endosymbiotic theory to have resulted from a symbiosis between various sorts of bacteria .

the biologist lynn margulis , famous for her work on endosymbiosis , contends that symbiosis is a major driving force behind evolution . 
according to margulis and dorion sagan , `` life did not take over the globe by combat , but by networking . '' 
symbiosis played a major role in the co-evolution of flowering plants and the animals that pollinate them . 
some groups of plants developed nectar and large sticky pollen , while insects evolved more specialized morphologies to access and collect these rich food sources . 
in some taxa of plants and insects the relationship has become dependent , where the plant species can only be pollinated by one species of insect .

consequently , the lineages of some canadian army units stretch back to the early 19th century , when militia units were formed to assist in the defence of british north america against invasion by the united states . 
the responsibility for military command remained with the british crown-in-council , with a commander-in-chief for north america stationed at halifax until the final withdrawal of british army and royal navy units from that city in 1906 .

these forces were organised under the department of militia and defence , and split into the permanent and non-permanent active militias -- frequently shortened to simply the militia . 
by 1923 , the department was merged into the department of national defence , but land forces in canada were not referred to as the canadian army until november 1940 . 
the first overseas deployment of canadian military forces occurred during the second boer war , when several units were raised to serve under british command .

in the 1950s , the recruitment of women was open to roles in medicine , communication , logistics , and administration . 
the roles of women in the caf began to expand in 1971 , after the department reviewed the recommendations of the royal commission on the status of women , at which time it lifted the ceiling of 1,500 women personnel , and gradually expanded employment opportunities into the non-traditional areas -- vehicle drivers and mechanics , aircraft mechanics , air-traffic controllers , military police , and firefighters .

as a result of these reviews , the department changed its policies to permit women to serve at sea in replenishment ships and in a diving tender , with the army service battalions , in military police platoons and field ambulance units , and in most air squadrons . 
the department further reviewed personnel policies in 1978 and 1985 , after parliament passed the canadian human rights act and the canadian charter of rights and freedoms . 
in 1987 , occupations and units with the primary role of preparing for direct involvement in combat on the ground or at sea were still closed to women : infantry , armoured corps , field artillery , air-defence artillery , signals , field engineers , and naval operations .

eastern catholic cardinals continue to wear the normal dress appropriate to their liturgical tradition , though some may line their cassocks with scarlet and wear scarlet fascias , or in some cases , wear eastern-style cassocks entirely of scarlet . 
when in choir dress , a latin-rite cardinal wears scarlet garments -- the blood-like red symbolizes a cardinal 's willingness to die for his faith . 
excluding the rochet -- which is always white -- the scarlet garments include the cassock , mozzetta , and biretta -lrb- over the usual scarlet zucchetto -rrb- . 
it is because of the scarlet color of cardinals ' vesture that the bird of the same name has become known as such . 
until the 1460s , it was customary for cardinals to wear a violet or blue cape unless granted the privilege of wearing red when acting on papal business . 
if a pope dies before revealing the identity of an in pectore cardinal , the cardinalate expires . 
beginning with the reign of pope martin v , cardinals were created without publishing their names until later , termed creati et reservati in pectore . 
though clerics , they were inaccurately called `` lay cardinals '' and were permitted to marry .

even if not a bishop , any cardinal has both actual and honorary precedence over non-cardinal patriarchs , as well as the archbishops and bishops who are not cardinals , but he can not perform the functions reserved solely to bishops , such as ordination . 
the prominent priests who since 1962 were not ordained bishops on their elevation to the cardinalate were over the age of 80 or near to it , and so no cardinal who was not a bishop has participated in recent papal conclaves . 
until 1917 , it was possible for someone who was not a priest , but only in minor orders , to become a cardinal -lrb- see `` lay cardinals '' , below -rrb- , but they were enrolled only in the order of cardinal deacons . 
in 1917 it was established that all cardinals , even cardinal deacons , had to be priests , and , in 1962 , pope john xxiii set the norm that all cardinals be ordained as bishops , even if they are only priests at the time of appointment . 
he is to collate information about the financial situation of all administrations dependent on the holy see and present the results to the college of cardinals , as they gather for the papal conclave . 
the cardinal protodeacon , the senior cardinal deacon in order of appointment to the college of cardinals , has the privilege of announcing a new pope 's election and name -lrb- once he has been ordained to the episcopate -rrb- from the central balcony at the basilica of saint peter in vatican city state .

however , in 1978 pope john paul i chose not to be crowned and opted for a simpler papal inauguration ceremony , and his three successors followed that example . 
when not celebrating mass but still serving a liturgical function , such as the semiannual urbi et orbi papal blessing , some papal masses and some events at ecumenical councils , cardinal deacons can be recognized by the dalmatics they would don with the simple white mitre -lrb- so called mitra simplex -rrb- . 
as of 2005 , there were over 50 churches recognized as cardinalatial deaconries , though there were only 30 cardinals of the order of deacons . 
cardinal deacons have long enjoyed the right to `` opt for the order of cardinal priests '' -lrb- optazione -rrb- after they have been cardinal deacons for 10 years . 
while in 1939 about half were italian by 1994 the number was reduced to one third .

cardinal deacons derive originally from the seven deacons in the papal household and the seven deacons who supervised the church 's works in the districts of rome during the early middle ages , when church administration was effectively the government of rome and provided all social services . 
the cardinal deacons are the lowest-ranking cardinals . 
the cardinal who is the longest-serving member of the order of cardinal priests is titled cardinal protopriest . 
the current cardinal protopriest is paulo evaristo arns of brazil . 
the dean of the college of cardinals , or cardinal-dean , is the primus inter pares of the college of cardinals , elected by the cardinal bishops holding suburbicarian sees from among their own number , an election , however , that must be approved by the pope . 
patriarch cardinals do not receive title of a suburbicarian see , and as such they can not elect the dean or become dean . 
cardinal priests are the most numerous of the three orders of cardinals in the catholic church , ranking above the cardinal deacons and below the cardinal bishops .

originally , however , this referred to certain key priests of important churches of the diocese of rome , who were recognized as the cardinal priests , the important priests chosen by the pope to advise him in his duties as bishop of rome -lrb- the latin cardo means `` hinge '' -rrb- . 
while the cardinalate has long been expanded beyond the roman pastoral clergy and roman curia , every cardinal priest has a titular church in rome , though they may be bishops or archbishops elsewhere , just as cardinal bishops are given one of the suburbicarian dioceses around rome . 
in 1587 , pope sixtus v sought to arrest this growth by fixing the maximum size of the college at 70 , including 50 cardinal priests , about twice the historical number .

the iranian languages or iranic languages form a branch of the indo-iranian languages , which in turn are a branch of the indo-european language family . 
historical iranian languages are grouped in three stages : old iranian -lrb- until 400 bce -rrb- , middle iranian -lrb- 400 bce -- 900 ce -rrb- , and new iranian -lrb- since 900 ce -rrb- . 
middle iranian languages included middle persian -lrb- a language of sassanid iran -rrb- , parthian , and bactrian . 
ethnologue estimates there are 86 iranian languages , the largest amongst them being persian , pashto , kurdish , and balochi . 
the term iranian is applied to any language which descends from the ancestral proto-iranian language . 
iranian derives from the persian and sanskrit origin word arya . 
the use of the term for the iranian language family was introduced in 1836 by christian lassen .

all iranian languages are descended from a common ancestor , proto-iranian . 
the indo-iranian languages are thought to have originated in central asia . 
the andronovo culture is the suggested candidate for the common indo-iranian culture ca. 2000 bc .

it was in relative proximity to the other satem ethno-linguistic groups of the indo-european family , like thracian , balto-slavic and others , and to common indo-european 's original homeland -lrb- more precisely , the steppes of southern russia to the north of the caucasus -rrb- , according to the reconstructed linguistic relationships of common indo-european . 
proto-iranian thus dates to some time after proto-indo-iranian break-up , or the early second millennium bce , as the old iranian languages began to break off and evolve separately as the various iranian tribes migrated and settled in vast areas of southeastern europe , the iranian plateau , and central asia . 
the multitude of middle iranian languages and peoples indicate that great linguistic diversity must have existed among the ancient speakers of iranian languages . 
of that variety of languages/dialects , direct evidence of only two have survived . 
genuine old persian is best attested in one of the three languages of the behistun inscription , composed circa 520 bc , and which is the last inscription -lrb- and only inscription of significant length -rrb- in which old persian is still grammatically correct . 
genuine old persian is best attested in one of the three languages of the behistun inscription , composed circa 520 bc , and which is the last inscription -lrb- and only inscription of significant length -rrb- in which old persian is still grammatically correct . 
later inscriptions are comparatively brief , and typically simply copies of words and phrases from earlier ones , often with grammatical errors , which suggests that by the 4th century bc the transition from old persian to middle persian was already far advanced , but efforts were still being made to retain an `` old '' quality for official proclamations . 
the other directly attested old iranian dialects are the two forms of avestan , which take their name from their use in the avesta , the liturgical texts of indigenous iranian religion that now goes by the name of zoroastrianism but in the avesta itself is simply known as vohu daena -lrb- later : behdin -rrb- .

the old avestan dialect is very archaic , and at roughly the same stage of development as rigvedic sanskrit . 
on the other hand , younger avestan is at about the same linguistic stage as old persian , but by virtue of its use as a sacred language retained its `` old '' characteristics long after the old iranian languages had yielded to their middle iranian stage . 
such hypothetical old iranian languages include carduchi -lrb- the hypothetical predecessor to kurdish -rrb- and old parthian . 
also , foreign references to languages can also provide a hint to the existence of otherwise unattested languages , for example through toponyms/ethnonyms or in the recording of vocabulary , as herodotus did for what he called `` scythian '' . 
these terms have little meaning with respect to old avestan as that stage of the language may predate the settling of the iranian peoples into western and eastern groups . 
certain is only that avestan -lrb- all forms -rrb- and old persian are distinct , and since old persian is `` western '' , and avestan was not old persian , avestan acquired a default assignment to `` eastern '' .

what is known in iranian linguistic history as the `` middle iranian '' era is thought to begin around the 4th century bce lasting through the 9th century . 
linguistically the middle iranian languages are conventionally classified into two main groups , western and eastern . 
the western family includes parthian -lrb- arsacid pahlavi -rrb- and middle persian , while bactrian , sogdian , khwarezmian , saka , and old ossetic -lrb- scytho-sarmatian -rrb- fall under the eastern category . 
on the other hand , the eastern group was an areal entity whose languages retained some similarity to avestan . 
they were inscribed in various aramaic-derived alphabets which had ultimately evolved from the achaemenid imperial aramaic script , though bactrian was written using an adapted greek script .

middle persian -lrb- pahlavi -rrb- was the official language under the sasanian dynasty in iran . 
it was in use from the 3rd century ce until the beginning of the 10th century . 
middle persian , parthian and sogdian were also used as literary languages by the manichaeans , whose texts also survive in various non-iranian languages , from latin to chinese . 
manichaean texts were written in a script closely akin to the syriac script . 
following the islamic conquest of persia -lrb- iran -rrb- , there were important changes in the role of the different dialects within the persian empire . 
the old prestige form of middle iranian , also known as pahlavi , was replaced by a new standard dialect called dari as the official language of the court . 
the saffarid dynasty in particular was the first in a line of many dynasties to officially adopt the new language in 875 ce .

medieval iranian scholars such as abdullah ibn al-muqaffa -lrb- 8th century -rrb- and ibn al-nadim -lrb- 10th century -rrb- associated the term `` dari '' with the eastern province of khorasan , while they used the term `` pahlavi '' to describe the dialects of the northwestern areas between isfahan and azerbaijan , and `` pârsi '' -lrb- `` persian '' proper -rrb- to describe the dialects of fars . 
the islamic conquest also brought with it the adoption of arabic script for writing persian and much later , kurdish , pashto and balochi . 
this development probably occurred some time during the second half of the 8th century , when the old middle persian script began dwindling in usage . 
tajik script was first latinised in the 1920s under the then soviet nationality policy . 
the script was however subsequently cyrillicized in the 1930s by the soviet government .

in eastern europe , mostly comprising the territory of modern-day ukraine , southern european russia , and parts of the balkans , the core region of the native scythians , sarmatians , and alans had been decisively been taken over as a result of absorption and assimilation -lrb- e.g. slavicisation -rrb- by the various proto-slavic population of the region , by the 6th century ad . 
sogdian 's close relative yaghnobi barely survives in a small area of the zarafshan valley east of samarkand , and saka as ossetic in the caucasus , which is the sole remnant of the once predominant scythian languages in eastern europe proper and large parts of the north caucasus .

daylighting -lrb- using windows , skylights , or light shelves -rrb- is sometimes used as the main source of light during daytime in buildings . 
proper lighting can enhance task performance , improve the appearance of an area , or have positive psychological effects on occupants . 
this can save energy in place of using artificial lighting , which represents a major component of energy consumption in buildings . 
lighting includes the use of both artificial light sources like lamps and light fixtures , as well as natural illumination by capturing daylight .

this is often done with fluorescent lighting -lrb- first available at the 1939 world 's fair -rrb- or rope light , occasionally with neon lighting , and recently with led strip lighting . 
recessed lighting -lrb- often called `` pot lights '' in canada , `` can lights '' or ` high hats '' in the us -rrb- is popular , with fixtures mounted into the ceiling structure so as to appear flush with it . 
as early as 400,000 bce , fire was kindled in the caves of peking man . 
oily animals -lrb- birds and fish -rrb- were also used as lamps after being threaded with a wick . 
with the discovery of fire , the earliest form of artificial lighting used to illuminate an area were campfires or torches . 
hundreds of these lamps -lrb- hollow worked stones -rrb- have been found in the lascaux caves in modern-day france , dating to about 15,000 years ago . 
the next major drop in price came about with the incandescent light bulb powered by electricity . 
gas lighting was economical enough to power street lights in major cities starting in the early 1800s , and was also used in some commercial buildings and in the homes of wealthy people . 
segmented sleep patterns disappeared , improved nighttime lighting made more activities possible at night , and more street lights reduced urban crime . 
lighting fixtures come in a wide variety of styles for various functions . 
the most important functions are as a holder for the light source , to provide directed light and to avoid visual glare . 
an important property of light fixtures is the luminous efficacy or wall-plug efficiency , meaning the amount of usable light emanating from the fixture per used energy , usually measured in lumen per watt . 
an incandescent bulb has a color temperature around 2800 to 3000 kelvin ; daylight is around 6400 kelvin . 
an incandescent bulb has a color temperature around 2800 to 3000 kelvin ; daylight is around 6400 kelvin .

lower color temperature lamps have relatively more energy in the yellow and red part of the visible spectrum , while high color temperatures correspond to lamps with more of a blue-white appearance . 
lighting is classified by intended use as general , accent , or task lighting , depending largely on the distribution of the light produced by the fixture . 
track lighting , invented by lightolier , was popular at one period of time because it was much easier to install than recessed lighting , and individual fixtures are decorative and can be easily aimed at a wall . 
a master transformer feeds all of the fixtures on the track or rod with 12 or 24 volts , instead of each light fixture having its own line-to-low voltage transformer . 
a modified version of this is cable lighting , where lights are hung from or clipped to bare metal cables under tension .

a torchiere is an uplight intended for ambient lighting . 
the portable or table lamp is probably the most common fixture , found in many homes and offices . 
the standard lamp and shade that sits on a table is general lighting , while the desk lamp is considered task lighting . 
this would probably fall under accent lighting , though in a dark nightclub it could be considered general lighting . 
the illuminated ceiling was once popular in the 1960s and 1970s but fell out of favor after the 1980s . 
this would probably fall under accent lighting , though in a dark nightclub it could be considered general lighting . 
in a movie theater , steps in the aisles are usually marked with a row of small lights for convenience and safety , when the film has started and the other lights are off .

street lights are used to light roadways and walkways at night . 
some manufacturers are designing led and photovoltaic luminaires to provide an energy-efficient alternative to traditional street light fixtures . 
floodlights can be used to illuminate outdoor playing fields or work zones during nighttime hours . 
sometimes security lighting can be used along roadways in urban areas , or behind homes or commercial facilities . 
entry lights can be used outside to illuminate and signal the entrance to a property . 
tail and brake lights are red and emit light to the rear so as to reveal the vehicle 's direction of travel to following drivers . 
headlamps are white or selective yellow lights placed in the front of the vehicle , designed to illuminate the upcoming road and to make the vehicle more visible . 
in the late 1950s , some automakers began to use electroluminescent technology to backlight their cars ' speedometers and other gauges or to draw attention to logos or other decorative elements . 
white rear-facing reversing lamps indicate that the vehicle 's transmission has been placed in the reverse gear , warning anyone behind the vehicle that it is moving backwards , or about to do so . 
flashing turn signals on the front , side , and rear of the vehicle indicate an intended change of position or direction . 
commonly called ` light bulbs ' , lamps are the removable and replaceable part of a light fixture , which converts electrical energy into electromagnetic radiation .

lighting design as it applies to the built environment is known as ` architectural lighting design ' . 
more critical or optimized designs now routinely use mathematical modeling on a computer using software such as radiance which can allow an architect to quickly undertake complex calculations to review the benefit of a particular design . 
for simple installations , hand-calculations based on tabular data are used to provide an acceptable lighting design . 
artificial lighting takes into account the amount of daylight received in an internal space by using daylight factor calculation . 
in some design instances , materials used on walls and furniture play a key role in the lighting effect < for example dark paint tends to absorb light , making the room appear smaller and more dim than it is , whereas light paint does the opposite .

photometric studies -lrb- also sometimes referred to as `` layouts '' or `` point by points '' -rrb- are often used to simulate lighting designs for projects before they are built or renovated . 
a set of lighting cues are prepared so that the lighting operator can control the lights in step with the performance ; complex theatre lighting systems use computer control of lighting instruments . 
motion picture and television production use many of the same tools and methods of stage lighting . 
the basic si unit of measurement is the candela -lrb- cd -rrb- , which describes the luminous intensity , all other photometric units are derived from the candela . 
the si unit for luminance is candela per square metre -lrb- cd/m2 -rrb- . 
the cgs unit of luminance is the stilb , which is equal to one candela per square centimetre or 10 kcd/m2 . 
the amount of useful light emitted from a source or the luminous flux is measured in lumen -lrb- lm -rrb- . 
it is analogous to the radiometric unit watts per square metre , but with the power at each wavelength weighted according to the luminosity function , a standardized model of human visual brightness perception . 
the si unit of illuminance and luminous emittance , being the luminous power per area , is measured in lux . 
the unified glare rating -lrb- ugr -rrb- , the visual comfort probability , and the daylight glare index are some of the most well-known methods of measurement . 
to define light source color properties , the lighting industry predominantly relies on two metrics , correlated color temperature -lrb- cct -rrb- , commonly used as an indication of the apparent `` warmth '' or `` coolness '' of the light emitted by a source , and color rendering index -lrb- cri -rrb- , an indication of the light source 's ability to make objects appear natural .

the daysimeter can gather data for up to 30 days for analysis . 
the small , head-mounted device measures an individual 's daily rest and activity patterns , as well as exposure to short-wavelength light that stimulates the circadian system . 
specification of illumination requirements is the basic concept of deciding how much illumination is required for a given task . 
lighting control systems reduce energy usage and cost by helping to provide light only when and where it is needed . 
many newer control systems are using wireless mesh open standards -lrb- such as zigbee -rrb- , which provides benefits including easier installation -lrb- no need to run control wires -rrb- and interoperability with other standards-based building control systems -lrb- e.g. security -rrb- .

occupancy sensors to allow operation for whenever someone is within the area being scanned can control lighting . 
passive infrared sensors react to changes in heat , such as the pattern created by a moving person . 
ultrasonic sensors transmit sound above the range of human hearing and monitor the time it takes for the sound waves to return . 
when motion can no longer be detected , the lights shut off . 
daylighting is the oldest method of interior lighting . 
due to a lack of information that indicate the likely energy savings , daylighting schemes are not yet popular among most buildings . 
in recent years light emitting diodes -lrb- leds -rrb- are becoming increasingly efficient leading to an extraordinary increase in the use of solid state lighting . 
in many situations , controlling the light emission of leds may be done most effectively by using the principles of nonimaging optics . 
beyond the energy factors being considered , it is important not to over-design illumination , lest adverse health effects such as headache frequency , stress , and increased blood pressure be induced by the higher lighting levels . 
similarly , designing lighting systems that maximize the right amount of light at the appropriate time of day for the elderly may help relieve symptoms of alzheimer 's disease . 
the human circadian system is entrained to a 24-hour light-dark pattern that mimics the earth 's natural light/dark pattern . 
when those patterns are disrupted , they disrupt the natural circadian cycle . 
a study conducted in 1972 and 1981 , documented by robert ulrich , surveyed 23 surgical patients assigned to rooms looking out on a natural scene . 
the study concluded that patients assigned to rooms with windows allowing lots of natural light had shorter postoperative hospital stays , received fewer negative evaluative comments in nurses ' notes , and took fewer potent analegesics than 23 matched patients in similar rooms with windows facing a brick wall .

earlier coal-gas methods had been used for lighting since the 1820s , but they were expensive . 
compact fluorescent lamps -lrb- aka ` cfls ' -rrb- use less power to supply the same amount of light as an incandescent lamp , however they contain mercury which is a dispose hazard . 
care should be taken when selecting cfl 's because not all of them are suitable for dimming . 
according to the energy saving trust , led lamps use only 10 % power compared to a standard incandescent bulb , where compact fluorescent lamps use 20 % and energy saving halogen lamps 70 % . 
the lifetime is also much longer -- up to 50,000 hours .

light pollution is a growing problem in reaction to excess light being given off by numerous signs , houses , and buildings . 
for example , glare creates safety issues around buildings by causing very sharp shadows , temporarily blinding passersby making them vulnerable to would-be assailants . 
if natural light is not present searchlights and flares can be used . 
from a military standpoint , lighting is a critical part of the battlefield conditions . 
however the use of light may disclose your own hidden position and modern warfare have seen increased use of night vision through the use of infrared cameras and image intensifiers . 
flares can also be used by the military to mark positions , usually for targeting , but laser-guided and gps weapons have eliminated this need for the most part .

texts on architecture have been written since ancient time . 
these texts provided both general advice and specific formal prescriptions or canons .

the role of architect was usually one with that of master mason , or magister lathomorum as they are sometimes described in contemporary documents . 
a revival of the classical style in architecture was accompanied by a burgeoning of science and engineering which affected the proportions and structure of buildings . 
at this stage , it was still possible for an artist to design a bridge as the level of structural calculations involved was within the scope of the generalist . 
with the emerging knowledge in scientific fields and the rise of new materials and technology , architecture and engineering began to separate , and the architect began to concentrate on aesthetics and the humanist aspects , often at the expense of technical aspects of building design . 
with the emerging knowledge in scientific fields and the rise of new materials and technology , architecture and engineering began to separate , and the architect began to concentrate on aesthetics and the humanist aspects , often at the expense of technical aspects of building design . 
there was also the rise of the `` gentleman architect '' who usually dealt with wealthy clients and concentrated predominantly on visual qualities derived usually from historical prototypes , typified by the many country houses of great britain that were created in the neo gothic or scottish baronial styles . 
formal architectural training in the 19th century , for example at école des beaux-arts in france , gave much emphasis to the production of beautiful drawings and little to context and feasibility . 
effective architects generally received their training in the offices of other architects , graduating to the role from draughtsmen or clerks . 
meanwhile , the industrial revolution laid open the door for mass production and consumption . 
aesthetics became a criterion for the middle class as ornamented products , once within the province of expensive craftsmanship , became cheaper under machine production .

following this lead , the bauhaus school , founded in weimar , germany in 1919 , redefined the architectural bounds prior set throughout history , viewing the creation of a building as the ultimate synthesis -- the apex -- of art , craft , and technology . 
when modern architecture was first practiced , it was an avant-garde movement with moral , philosophical , and aesthetic underpinnings . 
immediately after world war i , pioneering modernist architects sought to develop a completely new style appropriate for a new post-war social and economic order , focused on meeting the needs of the middle and working classes . 
they rejected the architectural practice of the academic refinement of historical styles which served the rapidly declining aristocratic order . 
the approach of the modernist architects was to reduce buildings to pure forms , removing historical references and ornament in favor of functionalist details .

architects such as frank lloyd wright developed organic architecture , in which the form was defined by its environment and purpose , with an aim to promote harmony between human habitation and the natural world with prime examples being robie house and fallingwater .

architects such as mies van der rohe , philip johnson and marcel breuer worked to create beauty based on the inherent qualities of building materials and modern construction techniques , trading traditional historic forms for simplified geometric forms , celebrating the new means and methods made possible by the industrial revolution , including steel-frame construction , which gave birth to high-rise superstructures .

many architects resisted modernism , finding it devoid of the decorative richness of historical styles . 
as the first generation of modernists began to die after wwii , a second generation of architects including paul rudolph , marcel breuer , and eero saarinen tried to expand the aesthetics of modernism with brutalism , buildings with expressive sculptural facades made of unfinished concrete .

but an even new younger postwar generation critiqued modernism and brutalism for being too austere , standardized , monotone , and not taking into account the richness of human experience offered in historical buildings across time and in different places and cultures . 
one such reaction to the cold aesthetic of modernism and brutalism is the school of metaphoric architecture , which includes such things as biomorphism and zoomorphic architecture , both using nature as the primary source of inspiration and design .

while it is considered by some to be merely an aspect of postmodernism , others consider it to be a school in its own right and a later development of expressionist architecture . 
beginning in the late 1950s and 1960s , architectural phenomenology emerged as an important movement in the early reaction against modernism , with architects like charles moore in the usa , christian norberg-schulz in norway , and ernesto nathan rogers and vittorio gregotti in italy , who collectively popularized an interest in a new contemporary architecture aimed at expanding human experience using historical buildings as models and precedents .

since the 1980s , as the complexity of buildings began to increase -lrb- in terms of structural systems , services , energy and technologies -rrb- , the field of architecture became multi-disciplinary with specializations for each project type , technological expertise or project delivery methods . 
a large structure can no longer be the design of one person but must be the work of many . 
modernism and postmodernism have been criticised by some members of the architectural profession who feel that successful architecture is not a personal , philosophical , or aesthetic pursuit by individualists ; rather it has to consider everyday needs of people and use technology to create liveable environments , with the design process being informed by studies of behavioral , environmental , and social sciences . 
environmental sustainability has become a mainstream issue , with profound effect on the architectural profession . 
this major shift in architecture has also changed architecture schools to focus more on the environment . 
sustainability in architecture was pioneered by frank lloyd wright , in the 1960s by buckminster fuller and in the 1970s by architects such as ian mcharg and sim van der ryn in the us and brenda and robert vale in the uk and new zealand .

the u.s. green building council 's leed -lrb- leadership in energy and environmental design -rrb- rating system has been instrumental in this . 
concurrently , the recent movements of new urbanism , metaphoric architecture and new classical architecture promote a sustainable approach towards construction , that appreciates and develops smart growth , architectural tradition and classical design .

the human development index -lrb- hdi -rrb- is a composite statistic of life expectancy , education , and income per capita indicators , which are used to rank countries into four tiers of human development . 
a country scores higher hdi when the life expectancy at birth is longer , the education period is longer , and the income per capita is higher . 
the hdi was developed by the pakistani economist mahbub ul haq , often framed in terms of whether people are able to `` be '' and `` do '' desirable things in their life , and was published by the united nations development programme .

baird broadcasts via the bbc continued until june 1932 . 
simultaneous transmission of sound and picture was achieved on 30 march 1930 , by using the bbc 's new twin transmitter at brookmans park . 
the bbc began its own regular television programming from the basement of broadcasting house , london , on 22 august 1932 . 
the studio moved to larger quarters in 16 portland place , london , in february 1934 , and continued broadcasting the 30-line images , carried by telephone line to the medium wave transmitter at brookmans park , until 11 september 1935 , by which time advances in all-electronic television systems made the electromechanical broadcasts obsolete .

after a series of test transmissions and special broadcasts that began in august , regular bbc television broadcasts officially resumed on 1 october 1936 , from a converted wing of alexandra palace in london , which housed two studios , various scenery stores , make-up areas , dressing rooms , offices , and the transmitter itself , now broadcasting on the vhf band .

bbc television initially used two systems , on alternate weeks : the 240-line baird intermediate film system and the 405-line marconi-emi system , each making the bbc the world 's first regular high-definition television service , broadcasting monday to saturday from 15:00 to 16:00 and 21:00 to 22:00 .

the two systems were to run on a trial basis for six months ; early television sets supported both resolutions . 
however , the baird system , which used a mechanical camera for filmed programming and farnsworth image dissector cameras for live programming , proved too cumbersome and visually inferior , and ended with closedown -lrb- at 22:00 -rrb- on saturday 13 february 1937 .

initially , the station 's range was officially a 40 kilometres radius of the alexandra palace transmitter -- in practice , however , transmissions could be picked up a good deal further away , and on one occasion in 1938 were picked up by engineers at rca in new york , who were experimenting with a british television set .

mechanically scanned , 30-line television broadcasts by john logie baird began in 1929 , using the bbc transmitter in london , and by 1930 a regular schedule of programmes was transmitted from the bbc antenna in brookmans park . 
television production was switched from baird 's company to what is now known as bbc one on 2 august 1932 , and continued until september 1935 . 
the first programme broadcast -- and thus the first ever , on a dedicated tv channel -- was `` opening of the bbc television service '' at 15:00 . 
the first major outside broadcast was the coronation of king george vi and queen elizabeth in may 1937 . 
the service was reaching an estimated 25,000 -- 40,000 homes before the outbreak of world war ii which caused the service to be suspended in september 1939 . 
on 1 september 1939 , two days before britain declared war on germany , the station was taken off air with little warning ; the government was concerned that the vhf transmissions would act as a beacon to enemy aircraft homing in on london . 
also , many of the television service 's technical staff and engineers would be needed for the war effort , in particular on the radar programme . 
the last programme transmitted was a mickey mouse cartoon , mickey 's gala premier -lrb- 1933 -rrb- , which was followed by test transmissions ; this account refuted the popular memory according to which broadcasting was suspended before the end of the cartoon .

according to figures from britain 's radio manufacturers association , 18,999 television sets had been manufactured from 1936 to september 1939 , when production was halted by the war . 
jasmine bligh , one of the original announcers , made the first announcement , saying , ` good afternoon everybody . 
bbc television returned on 7 june 1946 at 15:00 . 
alexandra palace was the home base of the channel until the early 1950s when the majority of production moved into the newly acquired lime grove studios . 
the mickey mouse cartoon of 1939 was repeated twenty minutes later .

this move was estimated to save the bbc # 85 million over the next five years . 
while the `` footprint '' of the astra 2d satellite was smaller than that of astra 2a , from which it was previously broadcast encrypted , it meant that viewers with appropriate equipment were able to receive bbc channels `` free-to-air '' over much of western europe . 
consequently , some rights concerns have needed to be resolved with programme providers such as hollywood studios and sporting organisations , which have expressed concern about the unencrypted signal leaking out . 
this led to some broadcasts being made unavailable on the sky digital platform , such as scottish premier league and scottish cup football , while on other platforms such broadcasts were not disrupted .

he was spotted and filmed in 2015 summer in his car , silver painted with bright aluminium forged wheels . 
the hummers that schwarzenegger bought 1992 are so large -- each weighs 6,300 lb -lrb- 2,900 kg -rrb- and is 7 feet -lrb- 2.1 m -rrb- wide -- that they are classified as large trucks , and u.s. fuel economy regulations do not apply to them . 
the conversion was reported to have cost about us$ 21,000 . 
after the election , he signed an executive order to jump-start the building of hydrogen refueling plants called the california hydrogen highway network , and gained a u.s. department of energy grant to help pay for its projected us$ 91,000,000 cost .

plymouth 's early history extends to the bronze age , when a first settlement emerged at mount batten . 
this settlement continued as a trading post for the roman empire , until it was surpassed by the more prosperous village of sutton , now called plymouth . 
in 1620 , the pilgrim fathers departed plymouth for the new world and established plymouth colony -- the second english settlement in what is now the united states of america . 
during the english civil war the town was held by the parliamentarians and was besieged between 1642 and 1646 . 
in 1620 , the pilgrim fathers departed plymouth for the new world and established plymouth colony -- the second english settlement in what is now the united states of america . 
throughout the industrial revolution , plymouth grew as a commercial shipping port , handling imports and passengers from the americas , and exporting local minerals -lrb- tin , copper , lime , china clay and arsenic -rrb- while the neighbouring town of devonport became a strategic royal naval shipbuilding and dockyard town . 
the combined town took the name of plymouth which , in 1928 , achieved city status . 
the city 's naval importance later led to its targeting and partial destruction during world war ii , an act known as the plymouth blitz . 
after the war the city centre was completely rebuilt and subsequent expansion led to the incorporation of plympton and plymstock along with other outlying suburbs in 1967 . 
in 1914 three neighbouring independent towns , viz. , the county borough of plymouth , the county borough of devonport , and the urban district of east stonehouse were merged to form a single county borough . 
the city is home to 261,546 -lrb- mid-2014 est. -rrb- people , making it the 30th most populous built-up area in the united kingdom .

it is governed locally by plymouth city council and is represented nationally by three mps . 
plymouth 's economy remains strongly influenced by shipbuilding and seafaring including ferry links to brittany -lrb- roscoff and st malo -rrb- and spain -lrb- santander -rrb- , but has tended toward a service-based economy since the 1990s . 
it has the largest operational naval base in western europe -- hmnb devonport and is home to plymouth university . 
an unidentified settlement named ` tamari ostia ' -lrb- mouth/estuaries of the tamar -rrb- is listed in ptolemy 's geographia and is presumed to be located in the area of the modern city . 
upper palaeolithic deposits , including bones of homo sapiens , have been found in local caves , and artefacts dating from the bronze age to the middle iron age have been found at mount batten showing that it was one of the main trading ports of the country at that time .

the settlement of plympton , further up the river plym than the current plymouth , was also an early trading port , but the river silted up in the early 11th century and forced the mariners and merchants to settle at the current day barbican near the river mouth . 
at the time this village was called sutton , meaning south town in old english . 
the name plym mouth , meaning `` mouth of the river plym '' was first mentioned in a pipe roll of 1211 . 
the name plymouth first officially replaced sutton in a charter of king henry vi in 1440 . 
the name plym mouth , meaning `` mouth of the river plym '' was first mentioned in a pipe roll of 1211 . 
during the hundred years ' war a french attack -lrb- 1340 -rrb- burned a manor house and took some prisoners , but failed to get into the town . 
in 1403 the town was burned by breton raiders . 
this location was further strengthened by the building of a fort -lrb- later known as drake 's fort -rrb- in 1596 , which itself went on to provide the site for the citadel , established in the 1660s -lrb- see below -rrb- . 
the castle served to protect sutton pool , which is where the fleet was based in plymouth prior to the establishment of plymouth dockyard . 
in 1512 an act of parliament was passed for further fortifying plymouth , and a series of fortifications were then built , including defensive walls at the entrance to sutton pool -lrb- across which a chain would be extended in time of danger -rrb- . 
plymouth was the home port for successful maritime traders , among them sir john hawkins , who led england 's first foray into the atlantic slave trade , as well as sir francis drake , mayor of plymouth in 1581 and 1593 .
