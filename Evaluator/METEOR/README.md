You need to download two files here before evaluate in terms of Meteor.

**meteor-1.5.jar** need to be downloaded from http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~alavie/METEOR/download/meteor-1.5.tar.gz by yourself, and place it in the same directory as meteor.py.

The **paraphrase-en.gz** also need to be downloaded from https://github.com/cmu-mtlab/meteor/tree/master/data by yourself into **data** directory.
